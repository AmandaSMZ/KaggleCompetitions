  So I read the comments about buying a size larger than what you'd wear, I normally wear 1x pants because my hips are bigger. Sadly 2x was sold out, so I bought 3x. It fit perfectly so make sure you're takin the largest body part (eithor hips or chest) add one extra size if you plan on only wear that but if you want clothes underneath add two sizes.By the by it super cute and fuzzy.

  There were a number of features I expected to see when the product arrived: pointed hood, embroidered house, trim color, quality seams and such. Although this product was a bit more than I would pay for a standard robe, I feel the delivery of all of these details justifies the price. Sizing was vague and difficult to find for a toddler - slightly too big, but overall worth it!

  My son received many compliments and requests for pictures when he wore the costume for Halloween. The fabric for the costume doesn't have that ""costume"" texture or appearance. My son was told that the costume is very well made and that his was the best pharaoh depiction that they had seen. He had a wonderful time showcasing this costume over the Halloween weekend so this item is considered a huge success. I highly recommend it!

  We have really enjoyed the Melissa & Doug products that we have bought over the years. However, this costume set could use some modifications. We bought two sets, one for our four year old and another for our two year old. Within one month one of the megaphones stopped working (we tried changing the batteries). They are a cheap plastic and I'm sure that it broke from being dropped, but this should be adjusted for in the design since it is made for children. And, the straps that hold the fire extinguisher and megaphone on the jacket are shredding because they get caught on the velcro closures. The most durable part of the whole set is the fire hat. It is a good heavy plastic and it is withstanding daily repeated use.

  I usually am a huge fan of Melissa & Doug products, however, this felt a little bit more cheap than their usual products. The jacket and the hat have kept together nicely, but the accessories broke within a few days. I wasn't hoping for forever with the accessories, but I was hoping for a longer than a few days. He still enjoys wearing his ""costume"" so for that I'm giving it 3 stars

  I purchased this for my 27 month old. It was the warmest monkey costume I could find for our cold mid-west Halloweens. It fit pretty well for being a 18-24 month costume (my son is shorter than average). A tad tight lengthwise but it still worked great. The little tail hanging in the back was my favorite. Such a soft/warm/great costume and very easy to put on and take off!

So happy with it, comes with a coat, name tag that a picture can be attached to, a stethoscope, a thermometer and a reflex tester (all toys of course) everyone at school commented on how cute it was and asked where I got it from. Not only great for play would also make a great inexpensive Halloween costumeIt very well made and the stethoscope also is battery operated and makes a ""beating heart"" sound, my daughter loves this feature!

  Great quality costume! So many of times, kids costumes are poorly constructed and don't last a week with my rough and tumble boys without getting holes or breaking accessories. Almost 2 months later with use almost daily, and this is still in perfect condition. Fits my slightly small for his age 3 year old and is a little big (which is perfect so he has room to grow) as well as my tall, long-armed 5 year old (won't fit him for much longer though...the arms are a slightly short). My only complaint is that it is not made in the US.

  The suit is decent quality and looks good when worn, but it only fits if you are close to ""average"" height.  I am 6'5"" and originally ordered an XL, which was too short (thought plenty wide).

  My kids wanted the whole family to dress as bats this year and I originally selected these Leg Avenue costumes because they have this costume in both kid sizes and adult sizes all the way up to 4X to accommodate my husband.  These costumes are terrific. As other reviewers mention, they are basically a hoodie so this may have been the easiest Halloween ever!  They are long enough to cover the bum so my daughter and I wore leggings and my son and husband wore black sweatpants.  The hoodies are really well made so my kids are just wearing them as super cute hoodies now. Win!

  I got the mask as a gag, not thinking it was at all functional. I put on the mask, and it's the same exact kind of mask that plague doctors used during the black plague, even including functioning.

  Love this costume! It fits me like a glove. For reference, I ordered a medium and I am 5'8"" around 135 lbs, c-cup bra. As the other reviews stated, the wrap things on the legs and arms do slide down easily, so I think I will just pin them or sew them in place as another reviewer said she did. The deep V in the front is very deep, so I recommend getting a deep plunge bra if you don't want it to show. Other than that, I am seriously happy with this purchase!

  Due to availability the week of Halloween I had to buy a size up. But the size 7-8 worked fine for my 5 yr old ...a little rolling up on the sleeves and he's good to go. It's an adorable costume if you have a super Mario lover. It's thin but that's fine, you just layer it over clothes. The mustache is a one time use sticker though. The hat shape is super cute. It wasn't an odd shape from the packaging. This is a costume that will be worn even after Halloween, as he pretends to be Luigi and runs around our backyard.

  This is a great costume! All you need to do is add boots and you're set - everything else is included. The fit is snug, but not overly tight. Your cleavage will definitely be on display. If you don't like that look you'll want to put a piece of lace or other material in the ""v"". Your butt will also be pretty prominent, so again if you don't want that you can cover it with a skirt or larger scarf than what is provided.As other reviewers have noted, the red strips of material will fall down if not fastened. I used a glue gun to keep them in place and that worked fine. It just takes a little time to get them right then glue them.I only wore the mask for a few minutes because I didn't like breathing in my own breath. It looks good for pictures though!Overall I highly recommend this costume if you want a slinky look. Once you have it on it's really comfortable except for having to use the bathroom. That takes a while since it is a jumpsuit. But I felt good all night and never felt like I had to constantly adjust it, like you do for some costumes.

  EDIT: Customer service reached out and was very polite and helpful. The agreed to fix the issue with their recent change in design and apologized for the delay in updating the product images to reflect the new design.Original: I like the costume, I bought the alien. However, when I placed the order the picture showed the alien wearing a silver suit that said Area 51 on it. The costume I received just has a green alien. My order page shows the alien wearing the silver suit but now the photo on the sellers page has changed.  Disappointed as I was expecting the item shown when I ordered the costume and having the suit that said Area 51 was important to the theme I needed the costume for.

  This dress up set it super cute and I love that the coat is supposed to be washable (haven’t washed it yet). My kids love the megaphone that makes a siren noise too.But I absolutely hate the hat. In my pictures you can see the adjustable insert inside of the hat. It’s great in theory, but it pops out all the time. It’s literally only held in place by four tiny pegs in these little holes. It drives me nuts because it’s constantly popping out and I have to fix it.  I tried to not use the insert, and my kids have very big heads but the helmet is just way too big without the adjustable insert. I really wish it was attached better.

  My kiddo loves this dress-up set!  It's great quality, similar to the other Melissa & doug sets we own (firefighter and doctor).  The parts are all very well made, especially the hat and vest.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 starts is because the goggles are very small at the largest setting, and tight on my 3 y/o's head, which he does not like.  His head is >85% for age, but I do not think these would fit a 5 y/o.

  My son loves pretending to be a police officer and ticket or arrest people. He doesn't like to wear full costumes. So this was good for him, its just a jacket and a hat basically. He loves it and wants to wear it all the time. He doesn't use the walkie talkie much though. Its kind of cheap honestly, can barely hear the little sound that it does make. But we have our own walkie talkie set, so no biggie. Everything else is great. He actually likes the plastic handcuffs better than the metal ones we also have.

The gaps are a little big, but if I wear a white camisole underneath, it'll work.

  Product was packaged in a box rather than the bag as shown. Makes it easier for wrapping as a gift. The jacket is a thicker material, I was nervous it would be plastic.

  My daughter loooved this dress! We bought it for a Disneyland trip and it was perfect. The quality was really so good, I feel it was better than you’ll find at most places, maybe even the actual Disney version. We have washed it already and it held up really well, I just hang dry to be on the safe side. It does give off a little gold glitter from the skirt, but it’s not terrible. I would say the sizing is roomy. My daughter wears 4 exactly and the size 4 was roomy. I was happy with it though bc I like to size up so she can get use out of it for some time still! If you want it super well-fitted I would consider sizing down.

  Cheap, cheap, cheap!! Last year we purchased the L. That costume was well made and the jacket was not attached to the shirt/skirt. This year we ordered a 1x/2x (needed a larger size). The difference in quality are striking!! The jacket is flimsy and ATTACHED to the shirt/shirt!. The costume is very cheap and flimsy. I would return but then I won’t have a costume by Halloween! If you're interested in getting a size 1x/2x don’t bother... It’s cheap looking, the jacket is not separate and it’s waaaay overpriced!!

  One of my kid's favorite costumers. The accessories like the shot and mask are a hit. Playdate friends love it too. The stethoscope cough is annoying to adults but doesn't seem to bother the kids.

  Cure costume except mine was missing the bow tie which is a big part of the costume. I ordered my normal size and it fits fine! Hoping I can get most of the creases out from the packaging and if the seller doesn’t respond about my missing bow tie I will have to look for one that goes w the costume. UPDATE no response from seller. Typical. $55 costume and it’s missing a piece! I ordered a black and white checkered bow tie to match the outline of the jacket and clash/coordinate w the striped/diamond pattern thigh highs I bought in black and white.

  My daughter is 4. I Bought the 3t/4t size. Fit perfect. Has just enough room to fit a thin longsleeve shirt underneath for a chilly halloween evening.

  We bought this super last minute for Halloween for our 16 month old. My son normally wears a 2T and the jacket fit well, just a little big in the arms. I’d day the sizing is probably a 3T. It was a huge hit and everyone loved the little fire chief! He got so much attention! By the way, what makes a big difference for this costume versus others is the quality/machine washable for dress up, and that it comes with 2 toys- a squirt bottle and bullhorn. The toys are quality, not just flimsy plastic. Love Melissa and Doug products!

  This witch costume is seriously cute.  One of the benefits of ordering online is that you can almost guarantee no one else will have your costume if you pick the right one.  My daughter loved this from the first time she saw it and you can't beat the price.  The detail is great and the colors are bright.  It's a velvet-like material.  It's cold at Halloween where we are, so this was perfect as the sleeves are 3/4 and I could add tights and legwarmers underneath.  My daughter uses a wheelchair, so we bought lights to go on her wheels (green to match).  She was a show-stopper!

  I just love my big ole dinosaur costume! Why did I buy it? just because it makes me happy and is so stinking cute....that and possibly a mid-life crisis since I am 55 years old. I decided to scare my BFF (a cop) the night after I got it when he was getting out of his car. I was waiting behind the house and once I was sure he didn't have his gun I came out from the dark making what I percieved to be dinosaur noises. Being a bit of a crabby guy, he just kept getting stuff out of the car while never taking his eyes off of me and looking at me like I was an alien. Then after I made a couple of somewhat inappropriate advances towards him as he was trying to walk in the house he couldn't help but smile.  The next afternoon I put it on again and started doing lunges, squats, running in place in the livingroom. Try as he might, he just couldn't take his eyes off of me or keep a straight face.  I plan to wear it around my yard this weekend and wear it to work in the near future. This is a must have for any woman's wardrobe!

  The quality of this set is much higher than I expected! The plastic of the helmet is a little thicker and more durable than I expected. The steering part is foam and seems like it will hold up, but our kids' interest level in it has been low so far. We could do without that.As far as the costume goes, it fits our very tall 4 year old and our average sized 6 year old but definitely wouldn't fit our 6 year old who is the size of most 8 year olds. The quality is better than the usual dress up - this could definitely be a Halloween costume if you wanted!

  I wore this costume for SantaCon (bar crawl). It's suggested to fill legs and Santa hat with newspaper. I used plastic grocery bags which looked more natural than bumpy/noisy newspaper. I also had to safetypin the Santa hat to my sweater to keep his head upright. Not a problem until I had to remember to unhook to use the bathroom. Costume was a hit overall.

  I absolutely love this costume! Great cut , well made and sooo flattering . I am 5' 6"" and weigh 135 lbs and I bought a medium and it's perfect . I want to go incognito so this is perfect with the face mask and hood . I bought a leather utility belt to wear with it so my friends don't recognize ( and I don't have to carry ) my purse . I wrapped the red ties around my leg a couple times and then once around my waist on each side . They are long enough to do so and it keeps them from falling down . I am thinking of tacking them with a needle and thread in a couple spots to keep the X in the ties in place . I am already thinking of repurposing this costume and cutting off the ties and painting bones for a skeleton costume next year . The jumpsuit with the hood is so cool , if it was a different material I would wear this out regularly  . The cut is just so great . I totally recommend this to anyone , it's one of the most flattering "" cheap"" costumes I have ever bought. Oh and I am a C cup and my regular ( black ) bra works perfect and is not too revealing at all . I guess depending on the look you want , I'm sure if you wear a push-up bra it will definitely accentuate your bust , but my bra is perfect and does not show too much . I can't say enough good things about it  , so glad I found it ❤️

I was hoping the boots would arrive in time for my party...but they may not, as they come from another vendor. I live in Florida, so the boots would only be for looks.

  If i can edit the post to include a better photo later i will but for now i just want to say it’s probably top of the line for the price (40 dollars after tax probably wouldn’t pay more than that) and i got mine exactly when delivery was predicted the day before halloween. On the subject of the costume itself, the hood is a tad big but as you can see i managed to just put it on partially the pants are nothing special just some cheap black thin sweatpants, really like the torso on it although the cheap fake leather while somewhat convincing isn’t easily moved. The biggest issue i have with it is that the bootstraps are made of the same cheap leather material and although they look cool are 100% not going over my calfs and even if i did get them over would cause tearing. The gloves were on the opposite end of the spectrum and my fingers couldn’t go all the way through. All in all i’m giving it 4 stars because i’ve seen significantly worse costumes for significantly more money

  I was worried this wouldn't fit since leg avenue does run a tid bit small but luckily it is perfect. if you are more on the 4x side, this might not work for you. it does have a decent amount of stretch but it is still snug. sleeves are just the right length, hood stays on well and the ears actually balance well ( i was worried they would flop to one side or the other ). the only complaint i have is that this might end up being to warm lol.  i will for sure wear this for more than halloween :D Oh and it def does not come with tights or anything, it is just the dress hoodie.

  Very cute!  Short and sexy but also warm which is great if you are going to be outside at all.  I paired it with tall white boot socks and brown boots. I am 5’4” 125 lbs and am wearing a small.  The only problem is you have to commit to having the hood up to have ears/antlers but then inside you will be too hot in the hood.  So I wore it down & bought a separate headband style set of antlers.

  I ordered this for my 5-year-old daughter and it fits her perfectly! She has worn it nearly every day since it arrived. Simple hoodie design. The hood is the perfect size and stays atop my daughter's head. Doesn't wrinkle easily. My kid gets agitated when costumes are uncomfortable, but this one is very cozy and warm. Highly recommended!

  I did a ton of research on this before I bought it.  Buying clothes on line scares me, but I'll have to say, I was very pleased with the fit.  I'm 5'2"" 145 lbs and large chest.  I went off the size chart by for bust and it was perfect. If I would have used other measurements, waist etc, it would have not fit.  It wasn't too short on me, was a few inches above my knee.  So just a word of advise, if you're unsure of size, always go by your bust size.  Other than that, very warm and cozy was just a little sad the ears didn't really stand up so it was hard to see the ""monkey"" part of my costume.

  The only reason I'm giving this costume a 1 star rating is because when it came in, it was missing a vial part of it. It was missing the ring to go on the outside to hold the fan in.  Thankfully, we bought a costume a few years ago that blew up like this one that had the ring with it. So we used that one instead. We were so happy that it fit this costume.

  I was on the fence about ordering this, I’ve not had much luck in the past with plus size Halloween costumes. I’m happy to say it fits absolutely perfectly. I purchased the 3X/4X, I’m 5’8 300lbs. I have very very large arms so I was afraid that I’d have to alter the sleeves in the very least but to my surprise they were super stretchy and accommodated them well.  the skirt comes down just above the knees, I added a homemade tutu underneath for a bit more fullness.

  The fabric was slightly stretchy so it forms to your figure. Very flattering. A little too low cut but you can put something under it if you want. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the zipper is too weak. It split when I was trying it on so I had to reinforce it with safety pins.

  We only got this yesterday, but it is already a huge hit with my almost 3-year-old son. He had to put it on immediately when I got home from work. Getting him out of it at bedtime was a negotiation, it spent the night on the shelf behind his bed, and he put it on as soon as he got up in the morning. His face just beamed when I told him that the hat made him look like Fireman Sam. He spent the evening running around spotting smoke and putting out fires. :)A couple of notes... I was glad that I read previous reviews so that I was prepared for the full impact of how annoying the bullhorn is. A piece of clear packing tape over the speaker turns it into a bearable toy. Also, other reviewers were correct about the inside of the hat falling out. I used some heavy duty household glue on that, which will hopefully solve that problem.

  I am biased, but my daughter looks frickin' adorable in this. I ordered the 2T, because she'll be a 2T when Halloween comes around. She's average-sized for her age and it fits perfectly. One drawback is the headband is for a kid with a bigger head (her head is also average for her size- she's in the 40th percentile), and the headband falls off. Hopefully that will fit in October, or we will find a replacement. All-in-all great quality and really cute.

We all laughed until we cried! When I got it I took it out of the package, installed the batteries, and tested it out to make sure it was all working properly so id have time to return and get a replacement if there were any problems. It worked perfectly! It did have installation instructions for the fan, but it was already installed when I got it. I don’t know if that’s something new they’re doing - or if mine was a return? Regardless, it works perfect, and we all had so much fun with it. It’s HUGE, and makes you SO TALL!!

  The hat is hard to get a good fit. It appears to be adjustable, but it's not very adjustable so it kind of swims on my kid's head. I like that it says FIRE CHIEF on the back, very cool.

  I’m really disappointed in the quality of this. The jacket is fine, but the other pieces are lacking in quality. The band that goes in the hat to size it is not built in and won’t stay in. It keeps popping out and frustrating my little boy. The other problem is the megaphone. It has a place for batteries, but we can’t even get it open despite having the appropriate size screwdriver. This in particular doesn’t make me too sad since I wasn’t expecting it to make noise, but it would be nice to have the option if we wanted to use it like that.

  Got the costume today, and couldn't resist putting it on. I'm about 6'1"" and around 180lbs and it fit just fine. Took a little bit of maneuvering to get into it, but plenty of room once I was inside. Your hands and feet have elastic around the wrists/ankle, and there's a fan inside which inflates it (pretty quickly) and is powered by 4 AA batteries which you have to provide. It also comes with two ""claw"" gloves. I was able to walk around in it easily, though because it is sealed it gets hot pretty quickly inside of it, so be prepared for that.One note on taking it off - once you unzip it or shut off the fan the air rushes out and it collapses on to you. If you're someone on the claustrophobic side make sure to prepare yourself for it since it takes a few seconds to actually get off.But so far this thing is awesome and I'm looking forward to using it on Halloween and many other occasions!

  I found this on a list for gift ideas for either a Kindergarten or five-year old girl.It's great.  My girl likes both the dress up aspect of it and the tools.One major advantage of this over other doctor toy sets is that the thermometer ""works"" without being put into mouths (or, heaven forbid, other orifices).  The child can just click a button, and a new temperature shows up every time.The stethoscope is also cool in that it makes its own noises--including coughing and heart beat sounds.  Just have two AAA batteries and a very small screwdriver ready to activate it.  Batteries and screwdriver not included!Our girl is five, and about 41 pounds, and the white coat seems just a slight bit too large for her--but it fits plenty well enough for playing.  Be sure to have a Sharpie handy to write the kid's name on the name tag.The mask seems to be the weakest part of the costume set.  It is poorly designed and doesn't stay on very well.We bought our daughter about 9 or so Christmas gifts in this price range, and this was by far her favorite!

  Seems cool. I'm about 5' 8"" athletic build, and it was baggy in the forearms. You have to have giant forearms or wrists to fill in this part of the costume. Fits a bit big. If you're a lot bigger or got meat on you, medium will fit and stretch on you to give you the full spiderman look. If you're any smaller, it'll be too big. Btw I tried it on for sizing only, before so there was a spot on the costume that has no color. No it's not ripped or anything. Must return it. Not sure if I want to order again.

  I really love this costume! I admit I don't have much of a history with costumes (I only wore a store bought costume once as a teenager and now I am in my 30s) and I wasn't particularly interested in dressing up with my cousin for the Disney Halloween party, at least until I found this costume. The colors, the quirkiness, and the touch of sass make it just what I like! I was unsure about fit, but this fits me very well. It is just big enough on me that I can get it on and off without unzipping, but it doesn't look big on me. For reference my chest is 48 and my stomach is 47. Those seem to be the two areas that might make the fit iffy for the 3x/4x if someone is more than maybe a couple of inches larger. I don't think it needs a ruffled underskirt with it if you don't want one (I do not) and is long enough I can wear a pair of short shorts under it. The bow tie has trouble standing properly but I can probably rig is somehow.

  the costume was PERFECT but the fit was just a bit too snug to wear it out and be comfortable.. I did not send it back because I would like to lose the weight and wear it eventually but purchasing an Xtra Large I would have liked for it to have been Xtra Large or for it to have been offered in a plus size that would have actually been an Xtra large. Super soft and cute though

  it's just a wee bit too tight. i feel bad for anyone who is actually a size 3x as it will cling and look lumpy. i normally fall between 1x and 2x and i am happy i chose the 3x size for wiggle room. the material is a bit thicker than i expected, a sort of thick felt. it's warmer than my usual fall hoodie, even! the furry material is not the most beautifully attached to the hood but it's fairly hard to notice. be sure to wear something underneath if you plan to reach for anything over your head. as you can see from my picture, the wings are fully attached to the body of the dress and will certainly pull it up. overall, i am satisfied with this costume/coat but the wings could have been made a little wider for ease of movement. i'm chalking up the frequent knocking things over issue to my horrible spatial awareness and depth perception problems. #blindasabat

  Great quality with real reflective stripes on the jacket.  Jacket is easy for my son, who is five, to open and close himself (velcro).  Helmet is adjustable.  Megaphone has a siren that makes an irritating and loud cry, but that's what they're supposed to do, right?  Extinguisher does not shoot water, just a fun prop.  Siren and extinguisher can be secured by velcro straps on the front/waist of the coat.  My son did have some trouble securing the extinguisher and siren on his own.  Overall, less expensive and better quality than the Infinity brand sold at Toys R Us, which has impossible buckles down the front of the jacket.

  Hey everyone, so I just tried on this costume and I have to say...It's pretty freaking awesome and here's why:Let's start with the fit. I'm 5'9 160 pounds, athletic build and I bought a size medium. When I first put on the costume I was wearing only ankle socks and some compression boxer briefs. There's two zippers on the back that meet. One starts at the lower back and the other one at the top of the back of the head. Slipping on the feet portions of the costume was a challenge, but I wear size 11's so that's pretty big for my height. After I stepped into the legs and did that I slipped into the arms and hands no problem. The real challenge was zipping up the back by myself! I have a rather large head so my biggest worry was the fit of the mask, but that fit perfectly! Seeing through the eyes isn't great but that's too be expected if you don't want your eyes to be seen. It took me about 2 minutes of fanagling to zip up the back but I go it. It's important that I tell you that the mask is attached to the costume. This may discourage you, but based on the thinness of the costume you can easily tuck the mask in the front and play the role of a Peter Parker who needs some fresh air. However this was already thought about by the designer which is why the area where your nose and mouth is is even thinner then the rest. This is done effectively without giving up appearance quality. Tucking the mask in will leave the back wide open due to the upper zipper being pulled so possibly a red compression shirt would work best for those of you who want to take the mask off frequently. Anyways, so the fit is fantastic! I feel like this costume was created just for me! It fits perfectly in all the right places. It's really a credit to Rubies. This is a quality product from what I can see.Okay, so now let's talk about appearance. Wow. This costume could not be more true to the comic book colors and design of the Spider-man we all love. It looks even better than the picture on here! One this that really bothered me about other costumes I've looked at is that the back of the costume was blank or the exact same black spider on both sides. That's just lazy. Rubie's stays true to the comics by having a large red spider on the back. If you still need another reason to buy this costume then look no further than the PRICE. I paid $33 for mine. Are you serious? What a steal. Buy this costume right now! You will not regret it! Feel free to ask me any questions. I will reply quickly being as I am always on my phone. Thank you for reading!

  Fits great!  I read a lot of reviews before deciding on the S/M for myself, definitely do the same if you are inbetween sizes or have proportions that you know may be problematic.I am 5'9"" medium athletic build and my weight tends to fluctuate around 185 +/-5 lbs.  I generally wear M/L in men's sizes, with M fitting on the tighter end, L being a bit looser.  15.5"" neck 34"" arm length.  34"" waist, 30"" inseam.  40-42R jacket and sports jersey size.  This should give you a really good idea of measurements and adjust for yourself.The S/M is almost perfect for me, the length/height is just right, however, the shoulders felt a little bit tight (I've always had wider shoulders for my build).  The waist and chest were perfect maybe a bit on the tight side but anyone lighter than 180lbs should feel very comfortable.  Taller slimmer men might be OK in this suit as well, but taller than 5'11"" you may be looking at a nuthugging/highwater situation.  The M/L however would probably end up really baggy.  Overally I'm extremely pleased with how the S/M fits me, I just need to do some crunches to get that gut into shape before Halloween!As for the suit itself, the quality and detail are outstanding.  While the patch and insignias are not exactly true to the movie (the Top Gun patch isn't used, a US Navy patch is missing, and juxtaposed) it is close enough to look outstanding and convincing.  The suit itself is actually pretty high quality and stylish compared to some of the other variants out there.  Really pleased and I'm looking forward to Halloween!!!

  I wore mine to work and had a blast. The yarn hair isn't as bad as some say. I had no problem with it at all. I even put bows in the hair to try and keep it out of my face. I did have a run at the very bottom of my dress at the end of the night but I will say its probably not meant to be worn while you work. The whole back is pink so be warned. I got a black cape and used that sense it was halloween and it covered it perfectly.

  The quality did not meet the expectations I have for Melissa & Doug. I didn't read the details carefully before ordering this, as I presumed a higher quality based on the brand. The doctor tools are cheap plastic; the stethoscope doesn't fit in your ears; you can't actually see through the ear scope; the thermometer is not recognizable to a child; and the lab coat's pockets are made from thick plastic like a shower curtain and came out of the package off-gassing plastic smell.

  My 2 year old wanted to be a construction worker for Halloween. I found this costume and it seemed higher quality than others so I went for it. It was a big hit with my son! Now months after Halloween, he's still wearing it around and it's holding up pretty well. The only problem we have had is with the helmet - the inner adjusting strap keeps falling out. I'm thinking I will glue it in so we don't lose that piece. He's 2 and the vest goes down mid-thigh. I'm not sure how well this would fit a child that's 5+.

  Love, love, love!  so adorable.  And, yes, if you want it to fit loose like the picture; go up at least one size.  I wanted it form fitting; so I ordered my size I normally wear.Mine did stretch, and I did ""stretch"" and pull on it to loosen it up.It is very warm when you put it on, and I was concerned; but as you move about in it; it does breath and you can fell the air come through the fabric.

  My grandson loves costumes and he was thrilled with this one.  Melissa & Doug costumes come in a heavy plastic bag that can be reused to put the costume away.  The quality is definitely visible and he will enjoy it for a long time.  3rd. costume I buy from them and he's loved them all.  He's particularly fond of the fireman one and also enjoys his construction one especially when ""working"" with his Daddy.  Would definitely recommend.

  My 3 year old son loves to play Dr with this set which Santa brought for Christmas.  The lab coat really seems to enhance the experience of pretend play.  We all know how much kids like to play dress up!  The only item I was a bit disappointed in was the stethoscope.  The ear pieces are very large and don't stay over his ears.  Also it requires batteries to make an artificial heart beat sound.  I would have rathered the kind with the foam where they can actually hear something (like the Fisher Price one).  But other than that (which isn't a huge detraction) this is a great toy that I would purchase again.

  As Halloween costumes go, this one is better than average quality. The only problem is, it only comes in one size.If you are 6' 4"" tall this will fit great. My daughter is 5' 2"", we had to use some rubber bands on the legs to pull it down where she could see out of it. The little fan that comes with the inflates the costume great.

  I wore this costume for a school function, and for kids to see it's great...but to the adult eyes it's just another cheaply made costume. First thing that I didn't like about the outfit was that the entire backside of the dress is light pink. (Which you don't see in pictures)  Another thing was when you put the wig on you get A LOT of bald spots especially in the back. I actually had to go to Hobby Lobby to buy more red yarn to fill it out...once I did that it was great! Also, an FYI to those wondering what ""standard"" size is...it's a L. But, it does tie in the back. Overall, the Sally costume gets the point across.

  I'm a grandma who purchased this set for my 3 3/4 year old grandson who is big into being a policeman and ""arresting"" whoever he can. This is one of the best designed and constructed costumes I have ever seen. Pockets in the front allow the child to carry the radio (sounds like a real police radio w/static!), whistle, handcuffs, etc. The hat has a badge that can be worn on the hat or attached to the chest pocket. There is even an identification card that can be completed and a photo attached. Also comes with a ""ticket"" which I made copies of so he could hand these out.Alex is big for his age and I would guess that the costume is a size 5.  Perfect for him now to wear over a shirt or sweater. under. He can easily wear it into next year. This costume is way more than expected for the price. So good, in fact, that I'm going to order the physician costume for Alex!

  I like writing detailed & thorough reviews so I expect this to be long. (You've been warned.) I, personally, scroll all over for super close comparison sizes from previous reviewers. If you do that too, I hope this can help.I first searched for a Halloween party type costume on here for my October birthday. I consider myself an average-to-short young adult woman, on the bigger torso side, with no curves or any thickness in any of the right places, and I have no junk in the trunk at all. I'm 5'5"", approx. 160-165 lbs, 36D, wear medium t-shirts, U.S. 13-14 in jeans, and prefer a *little* bit of tight clothing. I ordered a large and I'm super happy. Here's why.To start off, I'm obsessed with astronomy so seeing this pop up on my search was a no-brainer. It was delivered within 2 days, it's comfortable, the silver material is stretchy, & you can pick & choose what accessories to wear with it. I personally chose not to wear the clear plastic hoodie (attaches via velcro) nor the leg garter... yet. (Haven't tried it on yet, I think the costume looks fine without, but I will try it on again later.) I paired it with black yoga pants underneath for warmth, modesty for the rump, & at the recommendation of previous reviewers. (I'm wearing the leggings AND butt pads also from Amazon too, and this costume STILL is big in the back side. Not hugely though, it doesn't get in the way or expose your whole cheek or anything. If you have a butt, then you'll be fine. But my pancake flap jacks couldn't fill it. All good.) I love the zipper in the front so you can decide how much or how little of the ladies you wanna show off.  The shoulder pad part has a material that is thick/unforgiving, & makes it a little difficult to get over broad football player shoulders like mine. All I did was a little shimmy and it fit right over. Problem solved then fit like a glove. Other than that, it's very breathable, very comfortable, very cute, & I can't wait to wear it for my party. Like most one-piece costumes, it doesn't accommodate differences in shoulder widths, bust/waist measurements, or back side size/shapes. But the large fits me 99% well in 99% of the places, so I consider this a win. I didn't look at nor follow the size guide, so I can't comment whether it's accurate or not. I just followed all the review suggestions, my gut feeling, & my previous experiences in online shopping for Halloween costumes. Now, if I have to make a mad dash to the bathroom, this costume could prove difficult to remove in short time frame. Guess I'll just have to pay attention & give myself plenty of time.I can't find any major cons of this costume. My shoulders are big and my back side is small, so what? The costume isn't ripping nor falling apart. & it's super cute.Do yourself a favor & BUY THIS COSTUME! I absolutely love it & see myself wearing it for a few years. I hope this review made sense...

  worked great with my gorilla suit as harambe and the cop that shot him (fact check: it was the zoo that fired  on him,  but who wants to be suduced by a zookeeper? ) anyway the costume is stretchy and hugged my girlfriends' athletic curves well.

  Costume was made well enough.  However, it is insanely large.  I'm 5'10' 190lbs, based on the size chart online I opted for the m/l just to be on the safe side but it's HUGE on me.  legs at least 6 inches long and the torso is baggy, belt velcros are too wide to make up the difference at the waist.  Going to wear pants underneath to fill in the legs and make what alterations I can on the torso and shoulders.  Would return for the s/m but I needed it right away.

  I usually trust this brand. BUT Hard to believe that Mel & Doug put their name on this. Jacket not bad. Hat and everything else just pieces of crap. Hat too small for my 3 y o (big for his age BUT ) and would never fit a 5 y old. Piece of crap. Made  me feel it was designed to fit in an incredibly  small box for cheap shipping.

  Amazing price for such a good quality product! I ordered this, along with 2 others in the collection, on a Saturday morning and received it on Monday afternoon. Also, I paid only $5 shipping and handling for the entire order! What a deal. I was very impressed with the quality of the outfits and the amount of extras that were included. Out of the three outfits there was only one defect (missing earpiece on stethoscope). The outfits all have pockets, velcro closures, headpieces, name tags, and at least 3 accessories that make play dress up so much fun for my 4 1/2 year old. The size of the outfits are appropriate as well. They make great Halloween costumes, too, and are so much less expensive.

  My 6 year old son has a lot of fun in this costume! The color is a fabulous red with reflective stripes on the jacket that really shine! The FIRE CHIEF logo on the back is nicely printed in a large , white color. The hat, horn, fire extinguisher, photo ID, and the silver badge really add to his imagination during pretend play. The horn takes 2 AA batteries and makes a realistic siren sound at the push of a button. The extinguisher can be filled with water, but can not spray it-- only pour/drip when turning it upside down. This brand was the only one we could find with a red fireman outfit instead of other colors, so it's a hit !!

  I ordered two of these dresses for a costume party a few weekends ago. The shipping was fast and i was able to track the items. The package arrived 4 business days after the order was placed.The costume was great, pretty much exactly what was expected. It is a tight tube dress, it's a little short but I wore stockings underneath anyway. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that the garters depicted were made of elastic which means to keep them up they cut off circulation a little. They constantly fell off during the night so I gave up on them.Overall very pleased with this product and delivery.

  Everyone will be looking at you... everyone. Then they'll tell other people who will also be looking at you. Works wonderfully as an affordable hater-radar. Haters will instantly reveal themselves to you unprovoked! Helped to win first place as part of a Jurassic Park-themed team effort at an office costume/decorating contest. Sat in the cubicle with it on no problem. The clear window WILL get fogged up on a cool Halloween night, which we also used it for, so be cautious as it will become almost impossible to see. Meeting another hostile T-Rex in the street and immediately initiating a tiny arms fight however... well worth the effort required.

  This is a well made, sturdy princess costume.  My grand daughter lived in it for days before finally agreeing to take it off when she went home.  It comes with some fun accessories like gloves and a wand, think some jewelry too.  It's heavier than a Halloween costume and the inside has a sort of t-shirt which holds up the pointy sleeves.  If you ask my grand daughter she'll give it the highest amount of stars possible.

  The dress is beautiful in standard and plus sizes. Standard sizes are not great for big/tall girls. I ordered an XL because the reviews say it runs a little large. It fit my bust (40F) snuggly, but not terribly. It was a very “sexy” fit. However, because I’m 6’ tall, the part that hits the standard model on the hips hit me at the waist, above my hips, which looked terrible. I exchanged it for the next size up (1x/2x) which is slightly roomier, as many other reviews said, but is much longer. The cutout is different than the standard sizes and the skirt conceals the legs and hips more.

And I got lot of attention in the NYC parade!But I have quite tall height so the skirt was a little short for me but overall everything was perfect!All my friends told me that I am so beautiful and sexy, and I heard lot of ""Sexy Costume""from the people.Funny thing is, even I was saluted by real police officers.* my height is 5'9""-10"" ( 176-178cm)and my bra size is about...

  My son loves dressing up as a race car driver in this costume bc he wants to be a race car driver. From a parents point if view....the helmet is very cheaply made. The plastic part that is supposed to help it stay on their heads immediately fell out. We tried super glueing it but it still falls out. It is very big and does not stay on a kid’s head. The steering wheel is foam and kind of useless. My son never uses it. The outfit is nice. He loves wearing it.

  My kid is in his ""I wanna be a fireman"" stage, so this came perfect for him. The jacket is nice, well done and firm, and the accessories (helmet, fire extinguisher, megaphone and badge) also sturdy enought to withstand kids playing.The megaphone uses two AA batteries, not included, and when you put them on and press the button it justs plays a siren sound, at a very reasonable (low) volume. It's funny that I was disappointed by that, expecting a real mic amplifier in it (which I'm now thankful that it doesn't have one), but my kid just go with it, running and playing as he is in the fireman truck.

  I am 5 feet tall and 175 lbs and this fit fine. It was missing some pieces and was pretty basic so I returned it. I wanted  something better quality. The back is solid pink and not patterned so I thought that was pretty lame.

  Ordered this off Amazon because I couldnt find it at any local stores. Quality made and looked good. My issue was I am 6'2"" at 250lbs so I went ahead and ordered the 2XL because I wanted to make sure it fit me being taller than normal. The fit was awful it was extremely baggy and the inseam was way too short. I could only bear to wear it for a short period of time due to the inseam. So I ended up wearing it with the top down and tied around my waist. Overall great look but not made for taller people.

  Very cute, nice material, well made, definitely for cold Halloween nights. My only complaint is the sleeves are pretty short. My daughter is 7, slightly tall for her age, but not that much. I ordered a large (10/12) because I wanted her to be able to wear it beyond this year,  but the sleeves don't come to her wrists. She didn't care,  she loves it and will probably wear it everyday until she can no longer zip it up, but no way an 8 year old would be able to wear a large, let alone a 10 to 12 year old.

  The overall quality of the item is great. Thick fabric and plastic pockets on the lab coat. The ID badge is also very sturdy and allows you to glue a picture of your child in place.Only negative is that the surgical mask is poorly designed and will not stay on your child's face unless they have (abnormally) large ears....this resulted in tears and a tantrum from our 2yr old. It is something that could be fixed easily if you are even slightly crafty, but it's also something that should have been realized during product testing.

  The pictures and reviews show the dress and jacket as two separate pieces. They are NOT. I bought the 1x-2x size and planned to wear it to teach (all day) on Halloween; with leggings under since it's on the short side. I was glad to have the option to remove the jacket but they are sewn together. There is no back to the dress even if I were to try to separate the two. After trying it on it is a little snug and WARM. Not sure that I can wear it all day. May send back if I can find a better replacement.

  I ended up returning this because it was really small and it isn't really made for adult hands and feet. I really really wanted this costume to work for Halloween (2015) but alas it just fit awkwardly..I am 5'10 150 lbs and the medium was tight on me. I couldn't really fully zip up the back without worrying that I would tear it apart.The hands, as someone else had mentioned, had finger space of about two inches before the webbing started to go to the next finger...I don't know about you, but children are the only people I know with two inch fingers.The feet were really small. I don't have big feet for a guy...wear a men's size 9 and my feet are narrow, but I couldn't even squeeze my feet into them, once again, they felt like they were made for children.The packaging says recommended height of 5'3""I would avoid buying this unless you buy a size or two bigger, but even then you're going to have weird looking baby hands. The costume itself looked decent, the fit was just all wrong and not made for Americans.Review Disclaimer: I did not receive this product discounted nor was I asked to review it by the seller. I am merely posting this review in hopes to aid others in their decision making process and what size to get.

  Warm, snuggly, and perfectly sized. I'm 5'5 and 108 Ibs. I read some of the other comments that mentioned sizing up and almost got a large, I'm glad I didn't.I normally get mediums, but I can fit in a small sometimes as well, so I would suggest getting the size you USUALLY get unless other commenters with your measurements say otherwise.

  I purchased this costome for my 3 year son to wear on halloween.  He absolutely loved it and had a blast wearing it.  The vest was a little big but worked out well because he had a winter jacket on over it.My only complaint is that the inside of the hat has an adjustable plastic piece that gets fitted a round the child's head and is supposed to lock/ snap in to the inside of the hat.  The plastic piece would not stay in the holes of the hat and kept coming apart and causing the hat to fall off.  I had to crazy glue the two pieces together and then the hat worked fine.  Other than that I loved the product.  My son still plays with it now and its been weeks since Halloween.

  I bought this for my 3 year old niece, for christmas.  She loves pretty much everything these days, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she loves this doctor costume.  She immediately wanted to put it on and pretend to check everyone's reflexes and heartbeats, and to give everyone injections, etc.  She wanted to play with it right away.The only problem I have with it is that the stethoscope doesn't stay on when she puts it in her ears.  She has to hold it on, which makes it more difficult to actually use.  She doesn't seem to mind all that much, though, so I guess it isn't that big of a deal.

  I can't even explain how much I love this costume. I felt sexy without feeling slutty. You can wear something under the top if it is too low-cut. As-is, you should be wearing a ""U Plunge"" type of bra, or else the front will be very visible. I also grabbed some 2 sided tape to be sure everything stayed in place. It is very flattering and the waist scarf is great if you have a bit of a tummy. The material was thick enough that it wasn't see-through. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the arm and leg ties do not stay in place. I knew this was a potential issue from reading other reviews, so I put the costume on and tied the strings and sewed a couple points in place.

  Very comfortable and warm for Halloween! I seriously felt like I was wearing fleece pjs all day. I didn't give it 5 stars because the sizing is very off. I normally wear XS in clothes, but based on other reviews I decided to get a M. The M just fit me. The fabric isn't elastic, so if the fit is too small, the zipper will start warping and bunching up. Other than the sizing, it's a great costume and great quality. I would definitely get another one.

  Of course, I hopped onto the bandwagon and got this to surprise my kids on their first day of school. We had fun with it.This costume inflates with a build-in fan that runs on AA batteries, which is fantastic since I was dreading having to blow this thing up myself. It inflates within a minute or two after you get into it and turn it on.It's a bit awkward to get into, but if you put it on like a pair of pants (without shoes first, as there's not a lot of clearance for the foot holes), get your arms into the arm holes and then flop the whole thing over your head, zip it up, then turn on the fan, it's not too bad. Takes me a few minutes to be ready to be the king of dinosaurs and become unable to enjoy a game of Patty Cake.You will SWEAT like crazy in this suit. There's ZERO ventilation outside from that small hand-sized fan that brings in air to keep it inflated. When I used it to pick up my kids from school, I was drenched with sweat just being in an athletic shirt and shorts... but then again, it was 90 degrees with high humidity that day. If you want to go trick or treating on Halloween, I'd feel safe wearing very little with this on.There is a little viewing window and you can see pretty clearly what's going on... but just in front of you. There's no peripheral vision at all.I am 5'7"" with a thin, somewhat athletic build and the adult-sized costume fit me pretty well.The suit itself seems cheap and ""Made in China"" flimsy, so I had my doubts... but it hasn't busted a hole yet, and the tail drags on concrete, asphalt... everything. I haven't done any skydives without a parachute to test its durability, but for less than $50, it's already worth the gag I wanted it for.UPDATE 20180926: Not happy. The fan already busted. I've used this ONCE. Go figure that you can get replacement fans for $15... but still, only one use isn't very good. I took a look and noticed why it died: poor soldering, which allowed for one of the wires to lose contact with the fan motor (see photo). After re-soldering the contact points, it started working again, so that's good... but having to fix this in the first place is kind of a downer for something that relatively costs so much.

  My 2 and 4 year old boys LOVE this costume. I like that the helmet is adjustable so I can size it to actually fit, and stay on their heads. The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because I bought 2 sets of this costume, one for each boy, and the sticker on one of the helmets looked like it had been peeled off and ripped a bit, then pushed back down. It's not a cheap costume so I would have expected the main sticker on the helmet not to be ripped and placed correctly. Since I had purchased these for Christmas I didn't have time to send back to replace with a new one, or I would have. I would still recommend this for sure as the sticker was probably just a fluke.

  I have a son who just turned 3 in January and I'd wanted to start promoting his love of make-believe with some hats for dress up. Of course he has a firefighter one already and I thought an engineer cap would suit him perfectly, what with our huge Melissa & Doug train set and his adoration of Thomas since he was old enough to point to a train! When reviewing my options, I came across this role play set and decided it'd be worth the investment because it came with so many items that we could use in a variety of ways. The hat and apron are sturdy and adorable. The train schedule is part of what makes it a bit more educational, though I believe the educational level of any toy is what you make of it when playing and teaching your child. These things alone would have been enough, but the set comes with bonus items: a walkie talkie, hammer and wrench, all of which go in my son's tool box now. So they can be used for playing more than just trains. Very pleased with this purchase.

  This costume was a hit at my three-year-old grandson's birthday party. He wanted a ""dinosaur theme"" for his birthday party so I thought this would be a great idea. When I came through the gate with this costume on he lost his mind! When I unzipped the costume and popped out he saw it was just granddad. I asked him if he wanted to get inside with me and the response was ""of course""!It fits me well, I'm 5'-9"".

I stitched it up with needle and thread in a couple minutes about an inch and it was perfect. If it is was adults only I would have left it as it game. Sexy but classy at the same time. I usually wear a 6-8, I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. The straps do have a hard time staying up, nothing a stitch or two would cure though. Seems well made, overall very happy with my purchase.

  When I got my dress it didn't fit well at all. I got a 2X, because that's what fit my measurements. My suggestion is find the size that fits your hips! The back is stretchy and will stretch a few inches. And if you want it to look like the picture you will need a large underskirt for poof! But overall it is well made.

  Reading the reviews before purchasing this product probably saved some last minute costume changes. I am 5'4"" and 135. I originally would have ordered a medium, but everyone said this costume ran small so I ordered a large and I am so glad that I did. I just opened it up and threw it on over my tshirt and jeans and it fit pretty tight, but i wouldnt want it any looser. I plan on just wearing a thin tshirt underneath with some leggings or tights since it is made very warm with fleece material and it will probably fit just right. The length hit about mid thigh for me, so tiny bit longer than hoped, but will still work for halloween. It came in a plastic packaging like you would buy from a halloween store so the material is a little bent in the wrong places. I might try to flatten them out before i wear it.

  This costume is adorable. My daughter is 2 yrs and 7 months- average sized for her age. I was torn between 2T and 3T (she wears some of both but more 2 than 3) and went with the 2T--- it fits great and has a little stretch to it. The hat is very cute and comfortable and stays on great, too.

  This toy set is adorable and I was really looking forward to giving it to my 3 year old niece for Christmas.  However, within 5 minutes of her playing with it, the stethoscope broke right in half. The stethoscope is bent during the packaging of the items and that is where the break happened.  Very disappointing.  Now returning and replacing is going to be a hassle since it was a gift and now my sister in law is going to have to return the entire set to get a replacement stethoscope that will hopefully not break again.

  Item fits as expected, it's not hot, but also isn't really breathable fabric. It's great for 60-70 degree weather. Of course the stitching will start ripping with constantly pulling up the neckline to cover the bra or boobs. The ties around the legs are difficult with keeping in place, nothing a little pin or clip can't fix.

  Great costume, definitely do not wear if you like attention.Reason for 1 star off -- I wore this out treat-or-treating with my son.  Once the sun starts going down, it is very hard to see out of due to screening of the lookout portion, as well as that plastic portion fogging up.  It also has a plastic seam that, at least for me, kept rubbing on my forehead and became quite uncomfortable.  I would advise wearing a sweatband on your forehead and perhaps (sounds stupid but it works), a sock full of unscented cat litter to pull out the moisture from within the costume to prevent it from fogging up.

  This dress is made of quality material through out the body.  The collar area is cheaper, but it works.  The dress fits pretty close to size.  There is a bit of stretch in the material so it is comfortable to move around or sit in.  The hat, belt, badge and name tag all came with it.  I ordered the glasses the recommended too and they were worth it.  They are decent quality, especially for the price.

  I got this coatume as a birthday gift for my friend who is a huge attention monger. Of course he went nuts for it and immediate started wearing it everywhere.  He loves it.  Too much.  He wants to wear it all the time and everywhere and if constantly harassing me to try to come up with new and attention grabbing things he can do in the costume.  He had been skateboarding, bowling, rode a mechanical bull, ice skating, etc.  the costume is pretty durable. But highly annoying to ME.  Here are the pros: decent battery life.  He's been in it for a constant 9 hrs with no loss of battery.  Warm which is nice for cool climates.  Children LOVE it.  So do adults.  Not easy to rip or tear.Cons: you will be stopped for photos every fewMinutes.  Not asked for them, but literally yelled at, grabbed and harassed for photos by ADULTS WANTING SELFIES.  No one will respectYour group or the fact that you are having a social night out with your friends.  You are dealing with entitled adults who believe their wants and needs supersede anyone else's.  Their picture is worth more than your boundaries.  YOU WILL BE ASSAULTED.  This is based on the testimony of 4 people I know with this costume.  You will be hit, punched, smacked with sticks or objects, purposely have your tail stepped on, you will be squeezed to remove your air, and you will be grabbed.  A lot. This is fair warning.Other than that, it's cute.  It's fun.  Kids love love love it.  Adults can be a bit unruly.

  This was our first Halloween in our new neighborhood so we decided to dress up as Jack and Sally. The costume was fine for just sitting out on the front porch to hand out treats. I bought an extra-large size because I needed to wear thermal wear underneath my dress. Yes, it was VERY COLD that night! Quality was as expected - this was a one-night costume, not a party dress. I would not have been as happy if this were used for a costume party, where I would be up and walking around. Kind of cheap. The yarn wig was adequate.

  I ordered this for my 3.5 year old to wear for Halloween.  He is very small for his age and the vest was far too big for him but he insisted on wearing it anyway! I was pleased that the vest is very well constructed and not like most costumes that fall apart easily.  The hard hat is adjustable, and the hammer and saw that came with this are well-made enough that he (AND his 1.5 year old brother) will have a lot of fun playing ""construction worker"" for quite a while.UPDATE 04/03/13:  This costume is still going strong and is a favorite of my now 5 and almost 4 year olds!  The seams are holding up and the accessories are still in good shape.  The elastic on the goggles is stretched but that from the skirmishes between the boys over it!  Well worth the money spent!UPDATE 10/30/15: Yes, we still have the costume and it's still a favorite play item for my now 8 and 6 year olds, along with their 6 year old cousin.  It's useful life will be coming to an end soon since the children are growing but the costume has, with the exception of some fading/abrading of the reflective striping (a definite plus when trick-or-treating), survived a 5-year stint of ""work"" and play.

  I don't have much to add to the other reviews, except that the ""tools"" when put into the pockets carelessly, tended to fall out easily and repeatedly. I also think the quality is not up to Melissa and Doug standards for the higher price their toys bring.Also, to grandparents out there:If you are thinking of buying this for a grandchild, please consider whether their parent(s) will take the time to be the patient ""patient"". If not, this will be put away and never used again. It's definitely a ""play with me"" toy, and not a ""play alone"" one. While most parents play with their children, not all play pretend well, and that is what is necessary - over and over and over....as well as some knowledge of what the different instruments are used for.

  Very nice dress and fair price.  It's well made and will get lots of use from our niece who loved it.  She typically wears a size 6/7, but we purchased a size 7/8 so she'll have lots of time to wear it.  The 7/8, although a little big on her, fit well and will give her an extra year or so to fit into it and play dress-up.  We also ended up purchasing another outfit from this company after we had to return a separate dress from a different company for being way too small, despite it allegedly being a size 9/10.

  My little one loves this suit. This suit is very durable and really holds up to the rough play of my little one. This only critique I have about this suit is that the inside of the helmet was uncomfortable for my little one's head. So he eventually ripped it out and just used the firefighter hat without it. I used this in my homeschool as a teaching tool to teach about being brave and how to be helpful. We eventually went on to buy the knight and the doctor suit by Melissa and Doug too. Great products.

  My daughter's favorite Christmas present.  It has held up to being worn every morning and has washed twice without fading or pilling.  This is a great gift for your Harry Potter fan and much less expensive than what was offered at Universal Studios in Orlando.  Be prepared to get one for each of your kids, though...

  My granddaughter loves this dress. She wears it constantly. It is a bit shorter than some of the other dresses so it makes it easier for her to not step on it. The construction and fabric are excellent. The accessories really make the outfit complete. The crown ships flat and you slide the the side pieces into the main crown. If you want to be a Princess, this is a great way to look the part at a great price point!

  We had a problem with the wrong product being sent (the train engineer costume), but absolutely loved the construciton worker costume once we got it.  My only complaint is that the goggles are really small.  My 2 year old is on the 10th percentile for everything (he's a little guy) and the goggles barely fit on his head and left marks when he did wear them.  Otherwise the costume was excellent.  (And an excellent costume for a kid who doesn't want to be stuck in a costume and is very picky about what he wears.)

  I would usually get size XS from Leg Avenue, but this time I decided to follow their size chart, which was a mistake. I got size Small, and I was so disappointed when it came and I could easily fit three more outfits underneath. I'm giving this four stars, though, because I wanted to return it but postage costs so much where I live, so I wrote to Amazon and they credited back my payment, and the really nice rep told me through an email that I'm free to do whatever I want with the costume. So I had it altered (I had to take off a LOT by the way, since it really was too big) all around the waist, back, and even shoulders. And it looked so much better after that.

  In my past cosplay experience, it's usually true that you get what you pay for; but this is not the case with this Spidey suit!! Got it for the Spiderman Homecoming premier and I really do feel like the bug boy himself when I put it on!I am 5'11, and the medium fits fine but if I had even another two inches I would recommend the next size up. I have it stretched to the limit, but that's just because I prefer to wear it tight (being disproportionately skinny for my height). I've got a 28"" midriff and 45"" shoulders, and the medium fit great in both places. The crotch comes a little low (leg shafts a bit too short), but I can't blame anyone for that because I have freakishly long legs for a human being. If you too have an absurdly lengthy lower torso, you should be able to pin thr crotch up a little bit so that you don't have quite as much of a  web in your thigh gap. Plus that helps to show off the hot cross buns 🔥

  This costume came exactly as expected. Ordered the 2T for my Toddler who is wearing size 24 month and some 2T right now, I was worried it would be too big but I had him try it on with clothes underneath and it is perfect with some extra room! The mask is slightly big as expected but it will work for Halloween! I think we should be able to adjust it. Also love that the tail is detachable because I was worried it would get ripped off anyway! Cannot wait for Halloween to come already! Just wish these came in adult sizes as me and my hubby plan to be Owlette and Catboy as well!

  This was the best Halloween costume ever!! We bought it for my 10 year old son who is about 4’10” and it was slightly big on him, but the kids version sounded way too small. I think the parents trick-or-treating with their kids loved it the most! He had a lot of requests to run around and parents talking about what they would do with one as adults. It feels hot inside for a minute but the fan is super helpful. Because my son is a little small we had trouble keeping his face in the window but he managed, and it is an adult costume so totally not unreasonable. He LOVED his costume and says he wants to wear it next year as well, and even wanted to make sure I sent photos to his teacher because he was so proud. It held up surprisingly well as you could hear parts dragging on the sidewalk while we were walking around but it never got a hole or anything which is awesome! My older daughter was not trick-or-treating but still went up to the door with him to hold his tail because he kept knocking things over! The sound plays a few times also, but it was a pain getting to the battery pack! I would definitely purchase again. Maybe next year we will be a family of dinosaurs!

  This is pretty good quality considering the price. I bought two one for my husband and the other for me. Letting them air out because they had such a bad smell, ended up rubbing a small of lavender oil at the end of the nose, which I found amusing. It helped the smell, but that can't be good to breathe? Just be prepared that the pleather stinks and prepare accordingly for when you need it.It's adjustable and fit well after messing with it, the eyes are kinda flimsy but they work fine and you can see out of.

  My 4-year-old-son son absolutely loves it! I would give this 5 stars if the sticker on the fire extinguisher had a more water proof sticker on it. (It has begun to look worn after less than two weeks of play.) He has had a tad bit of trouble keeping the tools into the Velcro wraps on the jacket by himself, but it wasn't anything we could not work around. We got it for Halloween, but this costume has become a favorite dramatic play option. I think he'd wear it to preschool if we'd let him. The reflective strips on the jacket are ideal for trick-or-treating after dark. He was literally glowing in all the pictures that I snapped with my phone after dark.Overall, a very satisfactory purchase.

  My wife and I ordered this Mario costume (size Small 4-6) for our 5-year-old little boy and overall we like the costume but are disappointed by how cheaply made the product is. If your child is particularly rambunctious or rough on clothing this costume is almost guaranteed to tear due to the absolute bottom-tier materials.This Mario costume consists of the distinctive blue coveralls and red shirt which is really just one large jumpsuit with an opening at the back to slide the entire costume on. The back is secured by Velcro strips. Also included with this costume are the red 'M' Mario hat and mustache. Oddly, the distinctive white gloves are missing. We ordered my younger son the matching Luigi costume from the same brand and it comes with the gloves but no mustache, which again, is just a bit strange.The materials used in each of the components is 100% Polyester. My son loved his costume but as a parent, I dislike the cheap materials which really do a disservice to the Nintendo brand. The costume also runs incredibly hot. On a chilly Halloween night, both my sons were drenched with sweat from running around with these costumes on. Word of warning if you live in warmer climates.This product speaks to our throw-away culture and is really not built to last more than a single season. My son is a fan and the costume is cute and definitely fits the Mario character. However, carefully consider how your child will use the costume before ordering. If you're expecting a long life or repeated use this is not the costume to order.

  I LOVE THIS COSTUME! 10/10 I'm plus sized and 6ft tall so finding anything especially around Halloween that fits well AND makes me feel hot af is nearly impossible. Ladies and gentlemen, this reached impossible. It fits great and hides all the bits I want hidden while still making me feel sexy and not like I'm being hidden away. Like I said before, I'm 6ft tall and this bitch still has plenty of length left which is a first for me so I'm pumped! I wore 4"" booties with this and still had length. Huge fan, would definitely recommend to the tall girls out there! Can not stress enough how happy I am with this costume.

  I liked this costume but I thought the medium was really too big.  I wore this to the New York Halloween parade which was outdoors in cold weather and I had ample room to wear three full body suits inside. The sleeves and legs were still wrinkly though. I'm 5'3"" and 109 lbs - I usually like to wear my clothes a bit loose and so prefer a size medium but for this kind of costume I guess you need it to fit exactly right - that was my mistake. The costume itself was pretty. I jazzed it up with wings and despite all the elaborate costumes at the parade mine stood out a little bit too!

  I love this costume, I really do, but for an adult's one-size fits all, it is not for any adult taller than 5'7. As a 5'8 female I struggled to get into it without breaking the zipper. The length of the zipper isn't ideal for adults. It isn't about weight or size of the person, it is strictly the height. If you're on the all side, this particular dinosaur costume won't fit. That's not to say others won't. I ordered a unicorn for my nieces and their father who is 6'3 ended up wearing it without difficulty.

  This costume is adorable. My daughter loved the cat on it so she chose this costume. A couple of reviewers said it wasn't very puffy, but ours was. I puffed it up after taking it out of the bag. It is true to size in my opinion, but my daughter is tall for her age (3 years old) and the 3T/4T did drag on the floor when she was barefoot.I took a star off because of the hat. It doesn't stay on easily. When I had her try everything on a few days before Halloween, the hat fell off 4 times in 5 minutes. That was not going to work. I had some black fold over elastic so I sewed some on the hat to make a strap under her chin. It took less than two minutes, but the hat was perfect after that.

  pretty disappointed with the helmet on this. I decided to go with Melissa & Doug brand because I bought so many different dress up costumes over the years for little ones in my family and now that I have my own little ones  I wanted good quality for them as well. I tried to look closely at co.parable brands helmets because this was the main purpose for me for my little guys as I wanted something to be quality that will hold up over the years and stay on their head without a  strap to go around their chin. We have the firefighter helmet and that band on the inside is MUCH more functional than this. Somewhat of a pain to adjust but at least it stays the way you set it!This immediately comes apart. It has 2 separate snap pieces on it and neither stay together. I had to tape them both.  And then the little plastic post pieces have to turn weirdly upward to attach to the helmet a d it stays for a few minutes but it comes right apart when its taken off of a kids head  😑 i may try to tape that together as well instead of returning it but I shouldn't have to do that.I dont ubderstand why they would slack on this set when the firefighter helmet stays together no problem and is durable.The helmet part itself is however a good, firm plactic... but again... pointless if it can't stay on their head.I had contemplated also with trying a different brand before ordering this because it offered a few more tools with it which would have been fun also.  But Knowing the typical quality of Melissa and Doug I decided on this.Ill be ordering the other brand for my other little quy now to compare the two because Im so bummed about this Helmet.

  I bought this for my 2 yr old son for Halloween.  He loves it and wears it all the time.  The jacket is well made and withstands washing well.  The accessories are a nice addition and fun to play with.  We've had some trouble with the hat staying on and fitting properly, but my kiddo kinda has a big head so it may not be a design flaw =0. The jacket is a good size where it fits him now, but still has room to grow for a while to come.  Melissa & Doug have never disappointed and this costume is no exception.

  I’m 5’1 and on the bigger & bustier side and I wasn’t sure what size to get. I ended up ordering the L instead of the 1X. The costume was BEAUTIFUL and well made, I loved the material because it didn’t feel cheap, especially for the price. I had to return it though because it was too small. The 1X might be a good fit, but judging from the way the L fit, the 2X would’ve fit well/maybe slightly loose but I like it better that way than too tight. It was also very long but that’s to be expected because I’m so short. I ordered the Snow White costume from the same company and they’re made from completely different material. I ordered the L and XL in the Snow White and they both fit fine but I kept the XL and returned the L. You’ll feel like a real princess in this costume though!

  I usually wear a size Medium, but after reading the other reviews I ordered a size large and it fit great. I am 5'6"" 145 lbs, dress went down to mid thigh. I probably could have gotten away with a medium, but like others have said, it's a little tighter in the waist area, so the large was a safe bet, especially when I layered it with leggings underneath. It's fleece, so it keeps you pretty warm. I got a lot of compliments on it. Would wear/purchase again.

  Great fireman outfit. The outfit is made of high quality material and not just that cheap plastic I was use to play outfits or costume for kids being made of. The hat fits my 3 year old well. The bullhorn makes siren noises and there is a play fire extinguisher. My son love anything to do with firemen so he love this play out. It is a little big on him, but not too big that he can't wear it. I recommend this high quality dress up outfit.

  I got this costume in order to dress up as Cinderella for children's parties and immediately fell in love with it! I ordered a small because that's the size I typically am and it for as expected. I love that the back part is strechy too so it's very comfortable to wear. The material is very nice- not see through at all. Obviously it came a little long but I'm also 4'11 so that was expected- better too long than too short!!! The only two things I dislike is how low cut it is (but I expected that from the picture) and that part of the sleeves are itchy (but you should expect that with pretty much any costume!) I would 100% recommend this costume to anyone who is interested in buying it! Great for Halloween or for princess parties.

  This costume was a huge success & made my son so happy.  He got a ton of attention at his Halloween party & the costume held up ok under his natural abuse.  It lost a star because of a few negatives, that only mattered a little to my son.  One was that the zipper came out of one side of the zipper fob right as he was about to go Trick or Treating in it.  I'm sure he pulled it too hard, but it was a little flimsy.  I was able to fix it and jam the zipper back together, and then tape the slight opening where the zipper was separated, but it's a critical component to hold the air in & he won't be able to wear it again because of this.  The other was that it's too hot and awkward for long walks, which should be expected because of what it is, so if this is a problem for you, you should consider that factor.  If he had listened to me about wearing something different to trick-or-treat in, then it wouldn't have been a problem for him.  Overall the costume performed as expected, was a decent quality (with the exception of the zipper problem), and it was definitely a favorite costume with his peers.

  I ordered this costume for my son to wear to his community helper day at school. This is a very good quality jacket and accessories. The reason I gave it a 4 is because the piece in the helmet that helps it stay in place on the child’s head would not stay in place itself. You could not tighten it easily. It worked fine. He just simply had to hold the hat on if he ran or moved around a lot. Other than that I am happy with the product.

  Super late review,  but better late than never. I bought this costume for a Halloween party. It was part of a couple costume,  my husband being Marc Antony.  I was looking for something sexy but not too revealing.  This definitely fit the bill. I loved the body stocking except for no hole to pee! That definitely posed a problem while drinking.  It was also pretty warm while dancing, but then again I live in SoCal so it could be that too. By the end of the night I had taken off the stocking and left the overdress on . As a large busted woman, I was worried about the boob situation.  Ladies, if you are large chested invest in some boob tape otherwise you will see ANY type of bra you put on. Believe me,  I tried my whole arsenal. Those slits by the way, wow. They started at my waist! I will admit that it flared gorgeously while I walked. When I wasn't almost tripping on the extra length. Lol High heels would have worked better but I used flat sandals. For reference  I am a 5 foot 7 inch, 200 lb hourglass shaped woman.

  I love this costume.  I bought it to wear to my kids' preschool for their halloween party.  Super comfortable with black leggings and a black tshirt.  The kids liked it, and I can see this lasting a lot longer than most halloween costumes.  The quality is great.  It's made of thick fleece and is very warm.  Some people have mentioned that the hood is way too big.  It's just the style of it, and I like it.  I haven't had any problem with the ears being floppy.  The ears on mine stay up like they should.I'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs.  The medium fits me great.  It's big enough that I can comfortably wear layers under it, but slim enough that it's flattering to my figure.  I got a lot of compliments on it, and would definitely recommend it.

  The costume is as pictured and I think the design is pretty good and creative! I do think that for $50 they could have used nicer material. For example the gold bit around the waist is pretty cheap and flimsy and I don't think it will hold its form for very long. It is a good costume, quality is pretty typical of costumes I think, but it could be a little bit cheaper.

  Hello,I am not sure if I'm on the right forum or not but..here goes:My name is Bernie, I'm a single Tyrannosaurus Rex of the Theropod family originally from Laramidia or what you might know as the Western U.S. region. My parents were Malcolm and Tricia Bones originally from Gondwana (I'm first generation) who were both professional dancers however my father was banished from Gondwana after accidentally squishing the High Order King's daughter Linda during a Carnivore's Ball when he was 29. Well...anyway I still live pretty close to them and we raid a farm or city bus every other week for a meal and to catch up.Currently I'm working at a small seasonal theme park that operates spring through fall. My job is to scare customers without harming or eating them and occasionally do some landscaping however with my short arms I find it really hard to do anything involving any general lifting or pulling movements. In the winters I dress up as a reindeer at Malls but am required to stay perfectly still. My boss used to send me to schools but I'm not allowed within 50 feet after the last ""running incident"" where I ate about a dozen school children after I sneezed and they realized I was real....It isn't my fault it is in my blood to chase...Anyway I love cats, large mammal bones, going for a jog in the park, and I'm very in to history particularly Late Cretaceous periods discussing the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction and theories involved....I""m a nice enough guy honestly I'm just looking for a she-Rex that is pretty, likes humble guys, and enjoys a quiet evening in a cave gnawing on bones watching re--runs of the TV series Dinosaurs...Man was that show great!Please call me, don't text I really can't use my fingers or even pick up my phone most of the time....

  I would have given a 5 star rating, based on costume design,body fit and material.All  are great, but I was unable to get the costume to zip all the way up. The eyes and nose parts do not line up and there was no way to get the costume to zip all the way up. I took a Medium costume and the body was a good fit, still had some room so it was not fully fitted. Which makes the head portion unable to zip all the way up even more confusing.

  This costume's material seems a bit cheaper than the raptor one. I hope it lasts more than one night a year. If I can get 2 Halloween nights out of it I'll be happy. It looks great and is super funny to look at. Now. I sprung for the sound version with roars. I think it was like a $15-$20 add on. I tried to find reviews about the quality of the sound but couldn't. If I had to do it again I would not get sound. The sound consists of a small  hand held soundbox. For me I use the costume out in the yard during halloween and I wanted some sound effects but this will not do for the loud environmet that is my house on halloween. I shoulda saved my money and bought 2 small spears to attach to myself and plug it into an old Ipod or MP3 player.

  As people have said in this review before, I have to agree:- The legs on these are really long, if you wear boots, you'll be fine.- The sizing is pretty on par otherwise with regard to chest and waist.- I am 200lbs and 5'10. It fit me just fine.- ""2 Piece"" is slightly confusing, as the 'second' piece is the sunglasses.- The patches did start to peel off after an hour or so of use. fabric glue fixed it easily.

  This & the T-Rex were both purchased to surprise nieces & nephews & surprise them it did, but I think the adults had more fun wearing them, waving at peeps as they drove by & just having fun. The adults wearing them ranged from 5'5"" to 6' & it fit each very well. They are warm, so be prepared for that. This one has a sound maker, which was fun, but the T-Rex is silent. The material is a strong nylon feel, like a thin tent & so far have held up well. The air machine is small enough to fit in a pocket in the costume & worked very well. We played with them for over & hour & there is still battery life left.

  Im 5'8"", 145lbs, and it fit like a charm. Wore it to an anime convention for about three hours before changing out of it. During which I had to use the zipper several times to use the bathroom, eat, so on and so forth. At the end of the 3 hours I removed the suit completely and in doing so the zipper came right off. Later i was able to reattach it but for the price paid for this product I don't feel it should be a ""one use only"" type of deal.Aside from this minor qualm it was a major success and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick and easy costume/cosplay.

  Sure wish I had seen this before buying the playschool Dr. set for my 3-4 year old grandson.  Just like their Policeman costume (AMAZING quality and accessories), the Dr. set is way above average in construction and instruments. The stethoscope even gives coughing sounds. I does not give a heartbeat but none of the play sets do and at least this one makes noise.  4 great pockets to store the  ""instruments"" in AND a mask, which Alex loves most of all. The mask has Velcro so it fits any head by hooking over the ears. There is a place to write the child's name in on a card in the front pocket and a large, realistic medical emblem on the back. Like all of their costumes, the Dr. outfit comes on a hanger with heavy plastic over it. That way, after playing, the instruments go into the 4 pockets, the stethoscope over the hanger, the lab coat on the hanger and then cover it all up to hang neatly in the closet. Sure beats having all those items all over the house!  Melissa and Doug outfits really are worth way more than the  price they charge to get all of their extras. I'm careful with my money but I really believe these costumes are the best this grandma, or anyone can buy.

  Bought this for Halloween. More than I would have liked to pay for a costume but my son had his heart set on it. He is 5’4” and it was perfect for him. He could look out the lower viewing window. Seems decently durable. Made it though a couple hours of walking around and in and out of vehicle during Halloween. I am 5’7” and when I tried it on it fit fine. I was able to look through the upper panel.It was easy to use and figure out. It got tons of looks and my son had a blast.A few things I think they could improve on - a little more powerful fan. While yes it worked fine. It took a minute to re-inflate if he had to bend over for something.Only other issue was that there is a black mesh behind the plastic viewing pane- which helps hide your face. Only issue we ran into was that it was cold outside (approx 40 degrees) and it would fog up that viewing panel - since it had the black mesh on the inside it was kind of hard to wipe off. I would put my hand on the outside and my son would use his hair/head and push against my hand and wipe back and forth to wipe it off some. Also, once it was darker out he wasn’t able to see crap lol. While I must admit it was hilarious when he tripped and fell - (luckily he was fine).  But that it one downside. Can’t see your feet and hard to see when it’s darker outside.Overall I would definitely recommend this because we had some good belly laughs with it and my son had a riot.

  Great quality.  I bought a medium for my 20 year old daughter who is only 5' 3"".  This would be quite a tight fit on a man.  She eventually wore the costume without the hood as she found it very tight and claustrophobic.  She face painted the mask on with great results.  I'd go for a larger size.

  Like most female Halloween costumes, this runs on the small and short side. However it is pretty well made and is a nice stretchy fabric. It comes in your standard costume packaging.If you have long legs, you will probably have to either wear shorts underneath, or be prepared to be tugging down the dress all night. I also found the arm and leg band to fit very tightly, admittedly I have fairly muscled limbs, but it felt like the bands were cutting off circulations.For reference, I am 5'8"" 165 lbs, 41-30-41 and ordered the M-L. It did fit, but was quite short for me and she chest/shoulders were a little tight.

The ties however around the legs and arms would not stay in place and I only walked around the house for a few minutes in it. I'm 5'4, 150lbs and it hugged me where I needed it to.

  My baby girl was the cutest witch I had ever seen. She got so many complements on how cute she looked and I'm pretty sure her favorite part of the costume was the hat. The only thing I would suggest is adding a strap of some sort on the hat it kept falling off, which was very dangerous with all the cars and traffic coming through. We live in a small town where everyone trick or treats on the same street so stopping to pick up her hat every five seconds was a little tedious. Overall, the costume fit great and she loved it and so did everyone that saw her in it.

  Bought this for my 2.5 year old to wear as a Halloween costume and he absolutely loved it. I was happy because it was one of the few fireman costumes that didn’t come with an ax (because why does a toddler need an ax...) he is an average sized toddler and it was definitely a little big but I could easily roll up the sleeves and he was able to wear a coat under it for trick or treating. This is the quality you would expect it to be from Melissa and Doug and I would highly recommend for playtime or Halloween!

   The quality of the material on every piece of the costume is  impressive for $30. The sizing though, is way off. I got a Large but it definitely feels like an XL if not XXL. I am 6'3 and 185lbs. The shoulder straps I have tightened all the way to shortest notch and they are still too loose. I cut an extra hole in the straps to make it tighter. The waist is huge as well. Im wear a 32 or 33 and it feels like I have a 36 on that could probably stretch to a 42 if needed.

  Absolutely adorable bat costume or warm Halloween themed-bat jacket! I wore this for Halloween to a friend’s party and was the only one not cold outside and I got tons of compliments! If anything I was too hot inside the house, but it was just as cute unzipped With a cute tunic top and leggings and I brought a spare set of ears in case I had to take it off. I bought both a medium and a large because sometimes I’m in between sizes. They both fit but the large fit better in length and space to wear an outfit under while still showing my curves. The shorter length of the medium looked funny on me because the center point on the bottom front hemline hit at my crotch area in a funny place. I found it to be distracting. I ended up giving the medium size to my sister who is 5’2” and it looked better on her. For reference I am 5’4”, 36DDD, hourglass shaped. I usually order a large in this kind of apparel because of my bust and I like things to fit a little on the loose side, but still fitted, rather than tight to the body.

My twins are very tiny, in the 5th and 10th percentile. Thankfully these outfits fit! It actually fits my 4 year old who is big for his age (70th percentile) perfectly. I can't imagine it fitting a 6 or 7 year old.As far as the quality goes it's not bad. The jacket is nice but the toys are made in china cheep.

  The dress I received what actually very well made and super cute. I think it was better than what you buy in the stores. The back side of the dress bodice is made of a stretchy material so it does have some give. I'm usually a small/medium in dress sizes so I figured, order a size up. I received the medium and had to send it back. A small would have probably fit much better. Also, the dress was long and I had intended on wearing sparkly flats with this dress which it would have drug on the ground by an inch. It could have easily been hemmed if needed. I am 5'5"" 130 LBS.

  Laughter guaranteed!  I am a very petite female (5'2, 95 lbs) so I expected this to be somewhat large. I've ordered another morph costume from this brand before, and with both suits, I have had to bobby pin the head closer to the waistband to prevent drooping. Unlike the other morph costume, this one requires you to use your own stuffing. I used crumpled up newspaper and it worked just fine, however, prepare for lots of paper crunching noise when walking around!In my opinion, one disappointing flaw was the way that the oompa loompa's ""hair"" is attached to the plush head. No matter what I did, the hair would fall towards the front, completely covering the character's face.Despite how funny this costume is, I am giving this three stars because the quality is significantly lower than the other morph costume made by the same brand. I've included a picture for reference: I am Willy Wonka riding an oompa loompa, and my cat was my Wonka bar!

  We got the fireman set last year for Halloween for my older son (and the younger one went as a fire dog. It was really cute!), and we have used it again and again. They found a piece of plastic tubing in our shed a while back and that has become the hose. When kids come over to play, they go for the fireman outfit and the M&D construction vest and set again and again.  These costumes are totally worth the price, especially when they're on sale, because they hold up to rough play and the pulling on and off of little hands.  We bought the Knight costume this year for my older son, and I expect we'll have great fun with it long after the boom and bust of Halloween.  With all that said, the bull horn does break very easily as other reviewers have noted, and it did for us, too.  My boys still play with it and with the whole set, and honestly, I would rather they make their own pretend noises than listen to the battery operated ones, so I would say that maybe the broken bullhorn ends up being a win-win.

  My nephew is obsessed with trains. I bought this as a gift for his 7th birthday. I was a bit worried about sizing, since one reviewer bought it for their 3 year old and the manufacturer lists the ages as 3-6. I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. It fit him perfectly! The minute he unwrapped this, his eyes lit up and he begged to put it on. He has barely taken it off since! It was a huge hit. It also fits his younger brother, who is a small-for-his-age 5 year old, so it really can work for a variety of ages.The quality of this costume is excellent. It doesn't feel cheap or chintzy like some children's costumes I have seen. The material is thick and stitched strongly. The buttons on the shoulder straps are tightly sewn, so they won't pop off easily. It isn't the type of costume that is going to fall apart in one wash. This is something that will last in the dress up trunk for years. I definitely plan to buy more costumes in the Melissa & Doug line!

  The costume has a big patch on the left arm with the words ""tipsyelves®"" in bright white on the green background, and also four zippers, all with ""tipsyelves®"" in bright white on a green background (zippers that would be hard to hide in the interior of the costume). All to make sure everyone who sees you out for Halloween knows where you bought your costume. It being store bought isn't the issue, of course it doesn't look home made, but a good costume should be about the costume itself, not an advertisement for the company. (Also, it's small for the size listed.)

  Im currently 35 weeks pregnant and a pre pregnancy size large/10. I found the jacket to fit pretty true to size, it wasnt tight on my shoulder/arm area, in fact theres some wiggle room. This jacket actually manages to zip over my gigantic belly and bust area which I was not expecting at all based off the comments saying how small this runs. Its meant to be more streamlined and fitted, so keep that in mind when choosing a size. I expect it to fit just fine after the baby is born. Very stretchy too and the fleece is warm.

I had to cut it. But I’m only 5’3 so that’s expected I’m a short woman. I also appreciated that the bottom part of the dress was not that skimpy it had enough fabric to cover me enough, not like the smaller sizes that barely had anything to cover the bottom part of the out fit.

  I normally ordered small for dresses but i have bad luck with costumes ordering a small, so i got me x-small this time and it just fits well to me, the shoulder straps is a bit baggy and hanging on me but i just cut it about an inch and it fits well not to me, the dress lenght is perfect but it has a tendency to raise up and may show your privates so i suggest to be aware on this when wearing, i wear a fish nets hose it does looks good on me, i feel so sexy and hot with this outfit, i receive tons of compliments and i feel young,..

  I am 5'5 and usually wear a Large, but I ordered an XL based on the reviews of hearing it was tight or short. This length is perfect and goes about mid-thigh. Just order a size up from what you normally wear so that it is not too tight or the risk of shrinking it in the dryer. I had no tears, fabric is great and the tail is just hilarious! Worth the buy!

  This is so worth the money. It’s good for dress up or a fancy Halloween. We have some name brand dresses from a famous mouse company that shall not be name, and this dress is as good if not better made then those dresses. The glitter is really on there. The material is soft for synthetic material (doesn’t feel like plastic). There is a light petticoat to poof out the dress some but if you want it super poofy get a petticoat. I personally think it’s perfect as is though. It is a more traditional pink dress so not hot pink, think cotton candy or bubblegum. There is a lining for the skirt part of the dress to keep it from being scratchy with the under petticoat which is a muslin/cotton like material. There is this soft mesh material for the sleeves and it carries up to the neck. It is perfect for those tiny shoulders of your toddler or kiddo. I will be buying more from this company,  Relibeauty. Love love love this princess dress

  I LOVE this costume. It arrived 2 days before the expected delivery date. It comes in a cute plastic snap-close baggie with the picture of the model in the costume on the front and a plastic hanger. The fabric feels quite cheap but that's to be expected with a costume for one night. It's very warm, cozy, and the hood falls just right. I'm 6' tall, 140 lbs, D cup, and I usually wear a medium but after reading the other reviews I ordered a large and I'm glad I did because it fits like a tight medium. My only complaint is that it smells SO bad. Like a plastic factory threw up on a mildew blanket. I tucked dryer sheets into the sleeves and hood, sprayed it with febreeze a few times, and hung it outside and now the smell is (mostly) gone.

  My 3.5 year old LOVES this costume. He has played engineer 2-3 times a day since receiving it last week. The costume itself (like a bib overall with velcro on side) is quite generous, goes down past his knees so I know that we will get some great usage out of it. However, the hat is VERY small, it does not fit all the way on his head - he is 3.5 years old and the costume age range is 3-6.

  The costume arrived on time and in good condition and looked exactly like the picture. I wore a long sleeve black t-shirt and black leggings under it, and used the leg warmers on my arms, as they were too small to wear on my legs. (I bought some yellow ribbon to pin around my leggings to create stripes on my legs.) At a Halloween party at work, it was voted the best costume. When I wore it to hand out candy on Halloween night,  little kids were thrilled (""Mom, a bumblebee gave me candy!"") and their parents laughed. I'm 5'2"" and it was plenty roomy and comfortable, even when sitting in a chair at my office. Surprisingly, even though it's large it made me look slimmer, which is great!  A couple of friends borrowed the costume for parties - one is about 5 feet tall and probably 180 pounds; the other is about 5'7"" and a bit over 200 pounds, and it fit both of them fine.  Definitely a good buy. (Also - It easily packs up in a small box, and doesn't take up much room in the closet, which is nice.)

Bought a medium, but definitely could’ve gotten the small due to the stretch and extra room in the waist/ having to take the top in. Ended up wearing the pants backwards and purchasing a blue gypsie belt for $6 on Amazon! Ended up making me feel a little more comfortable in the costume :).

  I am 5'4"" and 190# so I was worried it would be too big or too small. I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly!!! It appears to be good quality, agree with other reviews that zipper does seem a little cheap but I think it will hold up well and if not I feel it would be worth fixing. I plan on wearing this as a cold weather ""hoodie"" so I wish it had pockets but think I will survive without pockets since I have badass bat wings instead!!! Would buy again and again.

  Ok. First of all, based on reviews, I did not think this would fit me, I figured I would need the plus size one. But it fit perfectly. I'm 5'8 and wear a size 16 in women's and this fit me. Yes, you have to do some twisting to get in it but it gets easier every time. I wore just a tank top and shorts and was sweating before it was fully blown up but I expected as much. I will say that the legs probably wouldn't fit someone over 6 feet tall, unless they have short legs. They were the perfect fit in me but with some room. I wish I had been able to actually wear it but my 2 year old grand was too afraid of it. I am saving it for when she gets older. But the neighbors got a good laugh when I was in the yard for a few minutes. I would buy this again with no hesitation.

  Melissa & Doug do it again!  My son adores all types of cars and loves to pretend that he is a race car driver.  This set takes his play over the top!  The outfit seems to be very sturdy and can stand up to the washing machine and come out looking great.  The patches are secure, this certainly isn't some poor quality costume.  I wish I would have ordered it sooner, it would have been a wonderful Halloween costume.  I can't say much about the steering wheel, for whatever reason it just doesn't appeal to him.  He far prefers to just drive around his little cars.  However, the next large box I get I think he would get a big kick out of sitting in it and pretending to ""drive"".  Don't hesitate to order this great set!  There is elastic at the cuffs so right now it is a little large on him but it doesn't bother him because the elastic still makes it feel like it fits.  However there is a lot of room to grow into it.

  This was a fun costume to wear for one time use. Looked and fit great, but after the costume was washed, the black dye from the body of the costume bled and caused the red ribbons to become discolored. It was washed with cold water only on a gentle cycle, so I was expecting the fabric to retain its color and quality a bit better. Now that it's been washed it just doesn't look and fit the same as when it was purchased. If you are looking to buy it, it fits pretty true to size, except lengthwise if you're short like I am. I'm 5'2"" and a medium (dress size 8) was perfect. I wore a pair of boots, so the extra length in the legs was not noticeable.

  I haven't dressed up since I was a child, but I've always wanted to. Time would just slip away from me or I couldn't decide on what to do. Last year was different. I found this on Amazon and fell in love with it. I've been working out a lot and have lost a good deal of weight, and wanted to really show that off. This costume is a really great mix of like a more modest sexy, if that makes sense. I was almost completely covered from head to toe, but was told over and over how beautiful and sexy I looked.I really felt so empowered in this costume!I'm 5,3"" 170lbs and 34DDD. Ordered a size large. The mini dress beneath the coat is extremely form fitting, but it is very stretchy! And the coat was snug in all the right places without hindering movement. My only complaints were that the coat, collar, and belt are secured by velcro and it's not the strongest velcro in the world. I sewed some buttons in to feel more confident nothing would pop open or off since I was going to be out partying with friends.

  The fabric is very thin sheer and not as bright or as thick as the picture. Back of dress is pink and see through. The product details should include that it has a tie back and is pink. The wig is worthless. There isn't enough yarn to cover your whole head and only sewn in one area. You look like a balding Sally.  Not to mention, it fits really loose. I had originally bought the accessories at a costume store, and very glad I did since they are sold out now. The wig I got was $20 and 100 times better from the exact same brand. This package costume is worth $19.99 at most.  It is too late for me to return at this point and get a new dress, the costume store has one for $50, but it isn't shaped right. If you are going for easy and on the cheap, this would work, but if you want to look good right out of the package, this is not the buy for you.

  I'm 5'8"" and weight about 150. I wear between a size 6 and 8. I was nervous because I have a long torso and long legs. I bought a large trying to be safe. This is the first costume true to size. the Large fit just fine, but a medium would have fit perfect. You can tie the sash around your midsection if you want to hide anything.

  This is made for people who are very skinny. I'm 5'8 235 lbs, and the medium was too short and too skinny. Lucky I was decorating a dummy in it for halloween, so size was insignificant. Get a size larger than what you'd normally wear. The quality is good for a $30 costume. It's by no means a professional looking costume. Cos players at comic conventions would laugh at it. But this is probably about as good as it gets for the price.

  While I would normally wear a medium or large in hoodies, I got this in xl and it’s perfect. (Halloween costumes always tend to run small.) It’s super cute and very warm so if you’re going to be inside you might want to rethink it. The only reason I took away one star is because you can’t stretch your arms over your head comfortably.

  I was both impressed and unimpressed with this costume. The sizes run a bit small which is not surprising except for the fact that I ordered another animal in this same line and the other one fit perfect. They were both mediums. This tells me there are no size standereds throughout the company. I am five 5'4"" 142 pounds and this costume was too tight. It stretches and would look the same a size up if you're going for the tight look but wouldn't bunch at the zipper. I did feel it was well built but poorly designed. The fin is not mid back like their picture shows. It looks like it's coming out your rear end. I have attached photos so you can decide for yourself.

  For a costume, this one is well made. The fabric is a decent weight and despite the washing instructions, weathered a machine wash and hang dry very well. I especially like that it came with interchangeable Goose and Maverick patches. The women's version of this costume has the same feature and gave me and my husband the ability to not be the same person (but really... who wants to be Goose?).The medium/large we ordered allowed my husband to wear jeans and a tshirt underneath, but it would definitely work fine without jeans under. All of the zipper pockets are actual pockets, which is very convenient.

  After reading many of the reviews on this costume I decided to go with the medium/large size. As with many others when putting this on, it does fit a bit tight in the crotch, but this can be fixed a bit once fully on by pulling down on the suit a bit. I'm 5' 11"" 205lbs and with a 44"" chest, 32"" inseam and 36"" waist. To me, it fit pretty darn perfect, though you may need a hand in getting out of it, as it is a bit snug and form fitting! I can tell you that the women at our Halloween party really loved the effect. You can't pull this costume off with a beer gut, so spare yourself  and go another route. Costume is fairly well made as others have also noted. I took off a star as others have pointed out that this were NO aviator sun glasses included with costume. Apparently this costume once included a pair, but alas no longer! Online wording saying 2 Piece needs to be changed, as it's only one piece, just the suit itself is in the package. Included are two velcro attached separate name patches. One for Maverick and the other for Goose. Honestly, I don't know who the heck would want to be the guy who ends up dead from a broken neck. The other name tag should be for Iceman. I ended up making my own Iceman name tag from the Goose one which I would never have used anyway. I blacked out the red lettering and then stick-on letters I bought at a hobby shop. It came out great. All other patches are well sewn on. Not certain what costume others are talking about saying they weren't properly attached as mine couldn't have been put on any better. Price on Amazon is much better than you'd pay at Party City as well.

  My grandson, now 3, is crazy about anything to do with fire trucks or firemen!  Loves to watch ""Fireman Sam"" on TV.  Got this for his birthday and he lived in it (and literally slept in the jacket) for the four days we were there for birthday celebration.  And it is HOT in Dallas in August!!!  Very nice, becuz the jacket is fabric and not some rubbery thing that would be wet/sweaty!  Not sure if my DIL will every launder it, becuz we thought it seemed more authentic with dirt smudges on it!  Am sure he will be able to fit into this jacket for multiple years.Fortunately, he can now dress up when his 6 year old sister dresses up - in something of his choosing!  Very cute and worth the price!

  If you buy this, plan on only wearing it only a couple of times. So basically, t's perfect for a Halloween party or two but the fabric will soon get caught in the zipper. That'll happen a couple of times, and then very soon the zipper will just break. That being said, the costume fit and looked fine. It's a fun thing to have, but it won't last you long. If that's okay with you, buy it. Also, I'm 5'10"" about 150lbs and the Medium suit fit me fine.

  This is a really cute costume for being somewhat cheap. I expected it to look cheap but it actually is much nicer than I expected. I wasn't sure on the size but I went true to size and got a Medium. I'm 5'7"" and 135lbs. It fits nicely and is a good length. The belt barely fits and I am on the slender side but I actually like it without the belt. I gave 4 stars because the hat is super squashed from being in the package.

  This dress-up set is adorable on our 3-year-old. Something about the fit is perfect and adds to the cuteness factor. But, from his perspective, it's not cute ... it's serious. He's locked up all the bad guys in the house, stopped a few crimes in progress and, of course, arrested his sister. (The handcuffs are easily removable.)He loves it, and we do too.Like other Melissa and Doug dress-up sets, the quality is solid. It will last. Oh, and the whistle isn't too loud!

  The concept of this costume is great, but the designer really cut corners in the design and materials that were used. The material is thin and more shear than is decent. The back of the dress is a solid color instead of keeping it consistent with the front of the dress. Though I understand why they put in the high neck (so you wouldn't have to do the neck make-up), it makes the look of the dress seem off. The gloves were fine. The wig was terrible!! There was barely enough yarn on it to cover the head bag it was attached to. I would have had to go out and buy more yarn and sew it on myself to get a proper look. When I buy costumes all I want to do is add accessories- not buy more materials to improve the product I paid for. I would recommend making your own Sally costume if you want something decent. The Standard and the Sassy Sally are worth the money.

  I ordered this costume for a Halloween party I had.  I was concerned because being short and a size 16, costumes often don't fit.  I was pleasantly surprised!  This costume fit fairly well, if anything was just a little big.  But I was ok with that.  I would rather it be a little big than too small.  My only issue was the neckline, it was just a little too low for my taste.  However, you could probably wear a cami under it and fix this.  Know that the skirt area was not fitted.  It was loose on me, which I preferred so I could wear something underneath.  Overall the costume is good quality, I got lots of compliments, and it looks really good on. I would highly recommend this costume.

  We went to Party City fully expecting to spend $40 on a costume - when we went we disliked all of the ones we looked at (we couldn't try on in store due to COVID). We decided to try Amazon instead and found this cute ""black dragon"" costume for the same price. This costume has exceeded our expectations. It's soft and velvety feeling! It zips up (instead of the buttons or velcro most costumes come with) and is pretty thick which will be great for our unpredictable Northwest Indiana weather! My son is in the 90% percentile for his age and at 1 year old is usually wearing 2T. We ordered the 12-18 month and it fits him great besides the arms are a little short but I chalk that up to my son being pretty huge for his age 😂 most long sleeves fit him this way. We are going to get a (hopefully long enough) black long sleeve shirt and/or hoodie to put under this along with black gloves if needed! The booties are awesome as well! We can fit his shoes inside!

  Great gift for my 5 year Old. He loves it. He’s had it for 6 months and unlike many toys that he may lose interest after a while he still loves to play with it. He’s a pretty big 5 year old and still has room to grow. Perfect for 3-7 year old You get so much for your money

  Ordering clothing can be a gamble but you can’t beat the price so I took a chance. My usual size in bottoms is medium but my hip measurements actually fell into “large”. I ordered medium anyway because a large would never work for my upper body. It fits perfectly! As everyone else mentioned, the leg wraps will probably need to be pinned. I didn’t mess with it too much yet.Bra suggestion... fullness v bra cleavage booster (something like that). I found it when buying this.

  This costume is super cute, but the fitting is off. I'm 5'1"" and the length is perfect.  If you are tall, beware, as it will likely be super short for you.  It fits perfect everywhere else (I'm typically a size 6) but it is very tight on the bust (I'm a full C).  I played around with the ribbon to open the bust more and made it work.  I have a small head and the headband is VERY tight.  Just a few tips to help the next person when ordering!

  My son still loves this costume.  Used for Halloween, and now we keep it in the dress-up box with a Construction uniform from the same company.  The fire extinguisher top screws off, although the nozzle is just pretend.  Occasionally small toys get stored inside, but are removed easily.  The helmet has been stood on by a toddler many times without damage. The cloth jacket has held up fine so far, without rips.

  Okay so I am an XL and I ordered a medium after reading all the reviews about how the costume runs large.. I have to say I barely squeezed into this thing..lol.. but it does fit!!! If you are a smaller size large you can possibly fit!! Definitely have to wear something underneath it haha if you are thick like me this costume is way too sexy LOL!!!! But the medium is basically for a really thick medium or a size large so if you know that sometimes you can squeeze into a smaller size than this will probably fit.. I took a chance.. And I'm glad I did

  I bought the police uniform and this fire chief uniform for my 3.5 yo son. Both costumes are adorable, well made (surprisingly so) and a hit with him and the other kids that have visited recently. My only complaint about the fire chief costume is that there aren't pockets for the accessories. Instead, there are two pieces of velcro that come together to hold those items but a 3 yo doesn't yet have the fine motor skills for that, so he wants me to fix it constantly. The police uniform has pockets so doesn't have this issue. Plus, the police uniform has been more of a hit among every kid that has played here recently. Both are adorable but if you have to choose, consider the police uniform.

  Very high quality lion costume, much nicer than others! The material is as soft as a nice blanket, so my son is super comfortable wearing it. I like how it's all one piece and the hood is attached (no Velcro to scrape his chin). We ordered three different lion costumes and this one was the clear winner. My baby's a bigger guy- 50th percentile for weight and 90th percentile for height- he's five months old and we got the 6-12 month costume. It's definitely big and a little baggy on him, but would probably fit most babies in the 6-12 month range fine.

  I can't wait to wear this! I was a little concerned when I ordered it, because as you probably know, most Halloween costumes are made so cheap that you can see straight through them...especially the tight fitting ones. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the material on this costume is not see through at all. It's actually quite thick. I tried it on and it fits perfectly, looking super cute and sexy without having to show a ton of skin. I ordered the medium (I'm 5'8"" and 145 lbs).  Even though it is a one piece, it fits my legs and long torso without any awkward creepage lol. Only thing is the red ties for the legs and arms don't stay in place. One end of each of the ties is already sewn on to the material, but then when you wrap it, the ties slide down. I will have to permanently sew the ties where I want them to stay. I still need to find some cute knee high boots to go with it...and it's definitely going to require a U-Plunge Bra.

I also wear rubber bands on my ankles because the suit was too long for me , I'm 5'2"" , 110 pounds and size 34DD , pant size 3 and the XS was perfect for me. Also I used a black elastic connecting the bottom to the front part under the zipper part ( Inside the costume , like a thong) because it's was too open so the elastic closed the costume a little bit and don't move for the whole night .

  Great quality that will surely last a while.  My three-year old loves this costume.  The megaphone is a bit annoying as it only makes a loud siren sound and doesn't actually amplify ones voice, but a bit of tape is all that's needed to make it less noisy.  I'm also happy that the fire extinguisher is a non-functioning empty container as my toddler would love to destroy our home with a water squirting device if he could.

  This is a perfect, classic costume that I hope I get the chance to wear multiple times! I am 5’9” and about 240 lbs so I got the 3x/4x. Everyone said it was a beautiful costume and asked if I made it.  The hat is super comfy and the whole outfit was easy to put on without messing anything up even after I did some intense make up.  The zipper in the back makes it easier to get over broad shoulders but then stretches a little when you zip it back up so it looks like it fits you perfectly!Also the delivery was super fast and it was packaged well. I had a great time at my party and this outfit was a huge success!!

  I have a few of the MD costumes and am pleased with the quality of them all. It can go through the wash and fits big and small kids. My 2 yr old can wear this or my 6 yr old. The piece in the helmet that goes around your child's head keeps coming loose and falling out. I'm going to super glue it to the hat. I think that will fix the problem.

  After a tussle with the USPS, which led to the original package to be stolen from my front porch, I received the “Top Gun” Halloween costume. First, the large was made for an extremely tall person, 6’6”+. Second, it was made for someone with a 44” waste and 32” thighs. It was far too large and baggy to wear to any Halloween parties or even take pictures in

  Bought this for my son for Halloween 2012. He was 3yrs old and 35 inches tall at the time. It coat is well made, it's waterproof and is roomy enough to wear layers of clothes underneath. The sleeves were a little long for him at the time. The hat was cute but the plastic inside kept popping out of the holes. The plastic badge was a little fragile and cracked after about a week. The ID card is cute and fits into the front pocket. The bullhorn is one of his favorite things... it has sounds that are not too loud. My only suggestion would be to add velcro on the fire extinguisher and bullhorn so they stick to the coat. There are rings on the coat to hang them on, but they fall off easily.  We hung a flashlight on one of the rings instead. Now my son is 4 yrs old, 40 inches and 34 lbs and the suit fits perfectly. He wore it with fireman boots from Target and got lots of compliments. He plans to wear it again this Halloween. Overall a good buy and worth the price!

My daughter is a size 14-16 girls and 2-4 in women (ordered a small). She's around 5'1""-2"".

  First of all, this costume is adorable and my 2.5 year old son loves it. He won't take it off. However, the walkie talkie died after five minutes of use and is now just a paperweight.

  Taking our girl to the bibbity bobbity boutique next week and wanted to save a little money by bringing our own dress. This dress is better quality and a fraction of the price than the Disney store gowns. My 7 year old is a size 8, and this fits great. The length is probably above the ankle on her, but she’s a on the taller side of her age group. She’s also thin, and this dress gives a little more room in the body, so it’s not exactly form fitting on her, but that’s great in my opinion and will let her wear it longer. If you’re buying it for play - it’s great quality and should last a long time! If you’re buying it for a party or for Disney like us, I would definitely use a steamer and get rid of all of those wrinkles from being shipped. It makes a world of difference! Especially if photos will be involved!

  The coat and accessories are very nice quality and my son loves it but I do wish that the accessories were able to attach in a simpler way that my son could do himself. As it is now, you have to wrap the 2 velcro pieces around the bullhorn and extinguisher which is difficult to do when also holding the item. My son runs to me every few seconds to reattach because of course the fun is in being able to wear these at your waist and then grab off to use. A simple hook and loop would have been much easier. Also the adjustable piece inside of the hat does not stay attached and without it the hat is very large and does not stay on head very well. A few small tweaks and this could be an even better product

  I would say this costume is the opposite of comfortable. I would classify this costume as dangerous.I purchased two of these costumes for my wife and I to wear, to surprise my 3 year old on his birthday. We also purchased a non-inflatable costume for him so we could all wear matching costumes and dance to his favorite songs on his birthday. Sounds like a fun time right?It was great for about 3 minutes. As the miniature fan blows air into the costume the dinosaurs head will rise until you can see through a plastic panel placed at the dinosaur's neck.The problem is the plastic panel is poorly constructed and has sharp plastic corners on each side. So as you walk in an inflatable costume, the head will bob because it's an inflatable costume so the plastic edges are wobbling around near your eyes. As a result the plastic scratched my eye and ruined my night. Luckily I wasn't bleeding. My neighbor is a Phycisians assistant. He told me the eye heals quickly and that i should be okay the next day. He was right. But I would not recommend this product to anyone. If the damage to my eye was more severe, I would likely have sued the company.Fair warning.P.s. amazon removed my first review despite the fact that this review complies with their guidelines. If they do not accept this review I will escalate the complaint and if that fails I will cancel my account.

  So for a Halloween costume this will work but it's not what I expected. According to the size chart, I should have ordered a medium but I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. The color is actually a brownish gray which is a bit strange and the fabric is a cheap fleece so eventually it will loose it's shape if not taken care of properly. It is warm so if you are going outside this will definitely keep you warm.

  My son is almost 5 years old and he loves bats. I know this costume seems very feminine but it really is only the top part that you get, which is very cute, warm and best of all not sexy. I wouldn't dress my son OR daughter the way this little girl is dressed. If you omit the make up, fish net stockings and colored hair piece this is an adorable costume for any gender. My son will wear this with black pants and shoes.Anyway, the costume is well made and cozy. It fits tight around the arms so you'll want to use a tight fitting undershirt. I got a size medium because I wanted to be able to reuse the costume for as many seasons as possible. My son is almost 5 and of average height (by American standards) and this costume fits perfectly. I was hoping it would be too big. It is a bit long which is to be expected because I ordered a medium but the arms are just right and next year the arms will be short and the torso will be just right I'm guessing. It'll work fine for us, but I was surprised nonetheless.

  It is so perfect. It puffs up like a princess dress. It stretches nicely. My daughter is 2.5 and I got the 3T. She is average sized. So go up in size if debating. It is the perfect length and she is a little shorter/average. It is an inch or two about the ground so it doesn’t drag on the ground and get dirty.Cons: There is more glitter around my house then on the dress. Within a week there will be no glitter left on the dress.

  Super fun and cute costume that we picked out for my daughter who was 20 months at the time. Since weather was a bit chilly, the costume provided some extra warmth. The only issue was the amount of buttons to close up the leg area. Soooo many!! But other than that, great costume for a great price.

  I bought these to be our twin 2 yo's Halloween costumes, and they love them! The coats are made out fabric and seem very durable, and the boys really loved having their own badges.  The only caveat is that the screws were stripped on both of the megaphones, making it impossible to put in the batteries. I personally didn't have a problem with not having two more noise makers in our house, but I thought I should mention it in a review. The attention to detail is remarkable. They even designed the hat so that it has an adjustable strap built in to help keep it on small noggins.They are so durable that the boys will be able to play with them long after Halloween (unlike the other costumes we looked at) and I plan on buying more Melissa & Doug dress up costumes for Christmas presents!

  Great dress it was just too big for me in the chest area. I'm 5'5, 36B cup and 155lbs. It fit in my waist but not my chest. When ordering a large size it would be recommended to be a size C or D cup to fit chest area. Or just make alterations to fit. I loved the dress overall but had to send back because I didn't have time to alter chest area to fit perfectly.

  Lots of stuff to play with here. Wondered before buying about accessories so want to let you know, as your friend, that the stethoscope does do some little things. 2 AA batteries will get you a cough noise and a heartbeat when you press the button. The little card that goes into the coat pocket is customizable so you can put your kid's picture and name on there. My daughter is 3 and she LOVES it. I have gotten several checkups, seems I am in good health and also my ears look pretty cool from what I'm told.

  There’s nothing about this costume I didn’t love! My daughter isn’t wearing the hat in this picture because it was windy and it kept blowing off her head.

  I was very pleased when I got the Fire Chief Costume Set.  The jacket is better quality than expected as it is more fabric than plastic.  My 2 1/2 year old son wore it for Halloween and while it was too big, he thought it was great, and it will last him for several more years.  The hat was also much more durable than the flimsy plastic ones he had in the past.  My only real complaint is that the bull horn makes noise when a switch is turned on and the noise is constant until he turns the switch off.  It would have been much better if he had to hold down a button to make the noise.

  My 3 year old son is obsessed with anything having to do with trains. On his birthday he wore this costume so he could be a Jr. Engineer :) The accompanying tools, radio and train schedule gave him hours of play time. The only drawback is the ""radio"" is SUPER LOUD! There is no volume, and the train whistle recording on it startled my son several times. The buttons were also hard for him to depress. The quality of construction of the costume surpassed my expectations. The pockets are sewn well even though they are a thick see-through plastic. The fabric is a heavier durable, washable, and soft material. The sides are kept together with velcro...I would have liked to see an adjustable slip tie in the back for my skinnier guy. Overall an excellent, non-cartoon specific train related outfit to encourage role play for my son.

  I'd like it if it were a little bit roomier in the hips and thighs, but it does work and it looks good.  Can't wait to try it out tomorrow night!  As other reviewers noted, this is a GREAT item if you WANT to look good/sexy but still be wearing a reasonable quantity of clothes for Halloween (i.e. if you feel awkward in so many of women's costumes which are WAY too flimsy - this manages to be both sexy and not flimsy.)  The full length body suit would (IMO) look awful on a lot of people EXCEPT for the red sash, which you can position wherever you like to cover up a multitude of lumps and bums, and the other red accents.  Overall, great costume.

  I absolutely pick my Halloween costumes based on how warm they can keep me and my and my frozen toes are in love with this giant bat hoodie! The fabric is like a blanket, the hood is INTENSELY CUTE, and the wing/arms are so much fun! This thing definitely runs small, though. I'm 5""5' and a 34B and I usually wear small/medium, but ordered a large for this based on reviews. It only just zips up on me! I'd have probably have been comfy in an XL as well! Fortunately, I won't be needing to layer for warmth wearing this delightful thing. The only downside I've noticed? The foam bits making up the claws and ears do take a couple days to dry (it's wet here in autumn; this happens). The blanket-like fabric also doesn't breathe very well, so if you're in a warmer spot you will definitely start sweating. On the other hand, I slept in this just fine the other night so if you're also that person who is cold all the time and has six blankets in the winter, I bet you'll like this as much as I do!

  The costume was a big hit and I got so many compliments!! Especially on the hat. I'm about 220 lbs and the size XL was just fine! Wasn't tight or too lose in some areas. Originally, I was going to get a plus size version, but after reading previous reviews I decides to go down to the women's XL because I wanted the dress and coat seperately. (In plus size, the coat and dress are connected and you can't take one thing off without taking off the entire outfit.) But I was happy with the XL, even though I had to pull the dress down almost every time I got up from sitting down. I think the only downside was the smell of the packaging it came in. Other than that, I absolutely loved it!

  My daughter is 3ft 4 and a size xs-s/5-6 brand depending. I ordered a size small to allow growing room and because reviews said this runs a bit small. As you can see the small is a little big on her, im sure a xsmall would have fit perfect. I would say these run true to size, theyre just more fitted. She loves it, its a warm fleece jacket, im sure she will wear it everyday once it starts to cool off. My only concern is how the fur on the hood will hold up in the wash-hopefully well.

  I loved the look of this costume. It is a little revealing but that made me feel really sexy wearing it. The thickness of the bodysuit was perfect, not too thick and not too thin. For those ladies that are large chested, you are still able to be accommodated. The only problem I had was finding underwear that were cut high enough on the sides so you couldn’t see them.  Great value for the money. I definitely recommend this costume.

  We really love this costume! We bought two adult sizes and one children's version. It's so much fun! I can't speak for the longevity of it since I only tried it on once, but so far, it seems great. The material is thin and plastic, so it feels like it could rip easily, but that's the same with any blow up costume from any brand. We've worn costumes like this in the past so we already knew what to expect and don't anticipate any problems.For what it is, it's a lot of fun. It's a bit challenging to see out of and walk in, but it really brings a smile to people's face. Enjoy and be safe out there!

I can’t express this enough. Other princess dresses are usually made with just one layer of that flimsy plastic like polyester fabric, this costume has multiple layers, including tulle! It’s absolutely amazing. It also comes with all the accessories. I’m telling you you wouldn’t find this quality even at the Disney store let alone a big Halloween store, and you’ll pay half the price for this one! I highly recommend

  Jurassic Park is mine and my husbands' favorite movie series to watch together, so when I came across the various First Look prank ideas for the wedding day, the dino suit was instantly my favorite! I bought the dino suit, knowing it would inflate over the wedding dress so as to not touch my hair, makeup, or dress and mess anything up. As you can see in the picture, the suit had the reaction I had hoped for!The suit itself takes about 10 minutes to fully inflate (though I recommend turning the pump on a little bit before you want to put it on so you don't have to fight the material to get it on properly). There are footy holes in the dino feet so your feet can go all the way through, with tight elastic around your ankles to hold the air inside (so you can put your shoes on AFTER you get the dino suit on, thank goodness). The sound box is in the palm of the right hand so all you have to do is squeeze and you are making ferocious velociraptor sounds (it wasn't as loud as I had hoped it would be, but you could still hear it)!The head is kept upright with an elastic headpiece that fastens almost like a helmet around your head. But once it's fully inflated, the head pretty much stays upright by itself and the headpiece is mainly for keeping your face properly positioned in the window so you can see the things you almost run into right before you run into them anyways because you're not used to having a tail.The reason I'm giving the velociraptor identity suit 3 stars instead of 5 is because right as I got out of the golf cart (I was hunched over, not quite sitting but not quite standing), the zipper busted, letting out most of my air and refusing to get back on the track. My dad then held it closed to blow up enough to finish the first look, but that's why in the picture the head looks like it's about to fall. Because it was.It was a great idea and I've seen people use these all the time with much better luck than I, apparently, but I was a little disappointed that it broke on me, especially on the wedding day and not the time I tried it on to make sure it worked properly where I could have fixed it!Oh, and don't plan on being inside it for very long. It's a sauna in there. Pretty sure I lost 5 pounds in sweat in the 15 minutes I was in it, which is good for your wedding day I guess.

  This costume was super cute, but it didn't fit me.  I'm 5' 5"" and pear shaped.  I tried the medium as it was listed for sizes 8/10 - it fit perfectly in the chest, but was too snug in the hips - it zipped, but puckered at the bottom and didn't look as cute as the model.  Also if you have arms that are slightly longer for your height, go a size up, the sleeves hit me an inch or so from my wrist.It is super cute though, so just order with plenty of time to exchange sizes if needed.

  I gave this 4 stars because as a 6"" tall man (The absolute shortest height I would recommend for a X-Large) it still rode up in the crotch area while being long on the legs (could be I have a long torso, but I'm pretty average build). The costume does looks great and the removable name tags can easily change throughout the night to decide who Maverick and Goose will be.

That’s not my sort of thing but I know a lot of people enjoy that so that’s a way you could get good use of it. Because of how limited it is with skin coverage, I think I’ll probably return but it is definitely a great costume to feel sexy in.

  The product description is misleading because it’s a how’s the pants but they are not part of the package.  The women’s version is the same price but because it’s one piece it includes the pants.  The kicker is that if you want the pants , Amazon sells it at an inflated price because they have software that has tracked your purchases.  Therefore you now have to pay a very inflated price to finish the costume.  All purchasing options are outrageously priced.

  Really fun costume. I ordered the teen size because I am 5’2” and petite.  The legs were pretty short and that’s saying something, as I have short legs.  I had to wear black tennis shoes and socks to make sure they blended with the costume as the elastic cuffs rode up my legs a bit.  I wish the battery pack had it’s own sturdy pocket built into the suit.  But it doesn’t.  The fan is part of the suit and then you have this battery pack hanging from a chord and it’s heavy.  So I had to wear shorts that I could clip the battery pack to inside the costume.  It’s just awkward while getting in and out of the costume because you don’t want to tear it or anything so you’re trying to wrangle with the battery pack.  Other than that, loved it.

  While deciding what type of costume to get for our 3 year old, we came across this Melissa and Doug Construction and thought it would be a great idea. Leading up to Halloween he has really enjoyed watching the Blippi Halloween song, which features that personality narrating while in a construction themed costume.This construction style costume is made fairly well and, overall, should last at least a couple of years, even with the occasional use during playtime. The reflective strips work great and are clearly visible when light reflects off of them. We were able to put the vest over his winter coat, had him wear his beanie with his hood going over the helmet, for a complete “construction worker in the winter time” look.As good as this costume is, there are some things that could be better and might turn those with really little ones off from buying this until they’re a little older. The goggles have no air, or breathing, holes, so after only a few minutes of wear they will fog up. We drilled holes into ours to prevent this from happening. The inner headband is not directly attached to the helmet and can come off without much effort. The connectors on the headband do not have very large points to keep the band from coming apart. The pockets aren't quite long enough to properly keep the tools from falling out, if the child moves quick enough, but the large pocket is able to fully hold the goggles.This Melissa and Doug costume is definitely a quick and convenient way to turn your child into a construction worker. If possible, we would’ve given this 3.8 stars.If you found this review ""Helpful"", please click the button below.

  After reading the reviews, I decided to give this costume a try. I am 5’8”, and wear a 16W. The body suit fit perfectly, which was a concern for me because I am long waisted and often times I typically have to order a size larger. Outfit was very comfortable and flattering. I did alter the body suit with a slit in the crotch because it was cumbersome to disrobe the entire dress just to use the restroom. Well made and beautiful!

  It is really nice quality for a bagged Halloween costume. It's really super cute on, but it was a little small on me. I generally wear a medium top, even in most juniors sizes. I could zip it, but it wouldn't have been comfortable. It is short, so I'm going to wear bloomers or maybe even leggings under it, but I'm really happy with the look of it! I already purchased the large and am sending back the medium with absolute ease. The seller, Pixie Sparkle, was very prompt and helpful in getting the exchange all taken care of.

  as a point of reference, i served in the navy and wore a flight suit every days for several years, so i know how these things are supposed to be made.  that said, i'm really impressed with the quality of this costume.  the material is a good, medium weight poly with excellent stitching. i have washed the costume and it held together fine...none of the seams came apart. all of the zippers are of good heavy quality and they actually work.  lots of pockets for carrying stuff around if needed.  all the patches look great and really make this flight suit stand out from others -- there were 3 mavericks (including me) at the halloween party i attended this year but none of their flightsuits looked as authentic as mine.on the sizing: i'm 6'1"" and 205 lbs...the XL was slightly large, especially in length -- if your inseam is less than 34"" then you should probably go with a large or be prepared to roll up the legs...which really won't work since the legs have the zippers at the bottom to widen the legs to allow you to pull the suit on over shoes/boots.

  I bought this and the fire chief costume at the same time and my 3.5 yo son prefers the police uniform by a lot. They are both great but this is just so much fun for him. It's surprisingly well made, has several accessories and fits him well (he wears a 3T-4T). My 6 yo niece can also wear it easily, although she is small for her age. Both kids had a great time ""arresting"" and giving tickets to the adults. They argued a bit over who got to wear the police costume and the other got ""stuck"" with the fire chief until time to switch, lol. This is a great purchase and I plan to use it at Halloween as well to save buying another costume.UPDATE: He is 5 now and this is still a hit!

  My daughter saw this costume and wanted it. It's super worth the money as the big box stores make you pay way more for cheap fabric. This dress is gorgeous and has crushed velvet sleeves and the hat is just perfect. We received thousands of compliments on this costume. It's also thick enough to not need a coat over if you live in Southern California. However layering underneath it would be super duper simple and you could still look amazingly witchy. My daughter loved it from the photos, loved it on, and rocked the costume with all her power. The dress is cute enough to be worn for dress up other times of the year and the photos will be priceless to you as they were to our family. I recommend this one million percent and will buy costumes from this seller again as they are just absolutely stunning quality!!!!!!!!!

I am a bigger person, weighing 243lbs at 5'6"", carrying most of my weight in my hips and thighs, and standardly I wear a US size 3x. I ordered a size 5x, and it fits perfectly, and isn't tight at all. I definitely won't be wearing this as a dress, but it is long enough on me to work as one without mishap. The fabric is very thick and warm, and I'm reasonably certain I'll be happy in it so long as the temperature stays below 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

  I love Melissa and Doug toys, especially the role play sets. This one has a lot of different things that come with it that are fun for kids to use when wearing it. The coat has Velcro under the buttons so the kids can get it together or apart easily. My only complain is that everything was sewn to the coat (instruments, pockets, etc) with red thread that had to be cut to get it out. It is hard for a kiddo to wait that long when they are excited to play with it.

  So I bought three of these because when you're in lockdown, why the heck not?  Seriously, convincing my two kids (10 and 12) to join me in inflatable dinosaur costumes took a bit of effort. ""Mom, it's not even CLOSE to Halloween yet!""  However, once they were in the suits, they completely embraced their inner T-Rexes!These are so easy to put on, zip up, and inflate.  I was concerned that my smaller 10-year-old son would have trouble seeing out of it, but he reported that he could see just fine.  There is clear vinyl just under the throat as well as under the chin for taller individuals.  We all had the BEST time walking around the neighborhood in these!  Even the neighbors and their kids came outside to see us.  We made lots of people laugh who drove by.I had a difficult time moving around in my costume, but it was only because I was laughing so hard at watching my two dino-kids run down the street ahead of me.  Our afternoon as a T-Rex family was one of the best days we've had in a long time.

  Ordered 7 and they were not all the same. Some had adjustable straps and some didn't. Even the ones with adjustable straps were WAY TOO LONG! I had to take almost six inches from each strap. Also was not a fan that the sleeves did not have a button close the sleeve cuff, going to have to sew buttons or velcro in to all 7 costumes... Once the alterations are made and they are pressed, the costume has a pretty authentic look to it... as long as you don't get too close. :)

  Love this dress. I will be wearing it to Disney World. It does run long which is great for me since I am 5""7 and there is about an extra 5 inches in length. The dress fits well. I usually wear about a size 6-8  and am smaller in the bust. I could wear a medium but since I am wearing this to Disney with my kids I don't want it to be too tight and revealing.  However from my experience working in a Halloween store many leg avenue costumes do run small and on the short side.It's very pretty on.

  This was a gift for our 9 year old Harry Potter enthusiast.  It was a bit large but then she is on the small size.  Most importantly she loved it.  Looks great & will be perfect for curling up to watch the DVDs or re-read these classics.

   I wanted to give this product a one star review because I was promised 2-day shipping and got it 9 days later. The t-Rex costume was for Halloween and it did not arrive till Nov 1. That being said I went out to hurry and buy a one at the local Halloween shop and they had I but for 2x’s as much. I had to explain to my son what was going on and why he wouldn’t get to wear his costume. Through tears and feelings of aggression we both mourned the loss of our Halloween costume.The next day it arrived and we were so happy he wore it to the grocery store and has taken it off when needed. It works great and fits great will fit all family members 5 foot tall and taller we only get to 5’10”. We have so much fun with this costume and it will be used for more than just Halloween.

  I wear a size 18 pant and got the women's 1X/2X and it fits well.The plunge line is very exposing. The eyelets for the plunge are very stretchy so the ribbon that comes with it can't really close the plunge the eyelets just stretch. It does not come with the black string that is pictured it is a tan ribbon. I laced it half way up and stuffed the ribbon inside the dress and it looks good enough.The dress is comfortable.Depending on how much dancing you are doing, you may need some shorts underneath but it is long enough to wear without shorts if you aren't doing too much dancing and bending.The head piece is very large, I may have to pin it. It does have a stretch band but unless you have a large head or a lot of hair it will be loose on your head.Overall I'm happy with my purchase, just wish is was a little cheaper.

  Great for a Halloween costume. I don't think it will hold up well in the washer so I gave it 4 stars. The fabric is very light and soft- not stiff and itchy. We didn't use the moustache since it was huge for a kid. Fit well on a boy who normally wears 5T/XS.

This should've been huge on me, but, I couldn't even zipper it!!!!  When I contacted the seller and told them I was not satisfied, the product was not sized as in the description, and that I was requesting a paid return label (since this wasn't my error)....they simply replied with instructions on how to print a return label, the cost of which will be deducted from my refund.

  There are only two sizes available, and my 11 year old son is too big for the child size, but way too short for the adult size. We originally ordered the child size, and then returned it for the adult size, but it’s so tall it flops around and he’s not sure he wants to use it anymore. Other than that, it works perfectly, just wish there was a middle size.

  Fun costume! Purchased for my nephews 4th birthday party - he loves Dinosaurs! He was a little scared at first thinking the Dino ate me....The costume is HOT, I wish there was an extra fan in there somewhere. Had it on for 10-15 minutes before I was soaked in my own sweat, literally a sweat box and maybe even lost some weight - haha! Granted, it was a summer day afternoon while wearing it outside.Recommend getting your feet in first, then your arms, then you kinda have to hunch back your way into it as you turn on the fan and zip it up. Fits me fine - I’m 5’5/110lbs.Super fun costume that I’m sure we will find things to wear it for in the future. Batteries are not included, requires 4 AA and you’ll need a small screwdriver to open the battery pack.

  This is by far the best costume I've worn out of any Halloween (except when I used to be a Power Ranger as a child of course). I was surprised at how durable the fabric seemed. Also, if you're anywhere where it usually gets cold, this is a great costume because the fabric is relatively thick and will keep you a comfortable kind of warm. Finally, the costume has a total of 3 pockets, which is great if you're carrying your usual gear (phone, wallet, etc.). Also, it has two zippers running up and down in the middle, which allows us to use the bathroom (urinating at least) very easily.This is a fantastic costume.

  The dress is gorgeous but the weight of the dress hangs from the mesh inner layer that forms the shoulders and sleeves. Within minutes after trying it on, the mesh shoulders started stretching and the dress started to weigh down causing my daughter’s feet to get caught in the dress because it was now too long. Had to return. It also runs quite large in the upper torso and underarm (mesh sleeves).

  For the price, this was a great quality dress.  Purchased for Disney World and our Perfectly Princess Tea Party with Princess Aurora.  As 5 year olds do, my daughter threw a fit and insisted on wearing a Belle dress instead, but another girl in the group actually was wearing this dress.  Price point makes it a popular option, and it won't disappoint.One recommendation though, take the pin off the dress before wearing - or at the very least before she takes it off.  The dress fits so tight, when you pull the dress over her head it's nearly impossible not to scratch your child with it.  Another reviewer commented on this too- I just forgot until it happened to us.

   My son wore this to his school's halloween party and danced the night away, whipping, nae nae'ing! He is a tall 10 year old so I had to go with the adult size (5'2"" and 96 lbs). Just had a long sleeve tee and jeans on underneath. He was toasty warm even before he started dancing.  Easy to put on but I recommend you do it carefully because the material seems thin and the zipper looks like it could get stuck if you zip it up too quick so take your time!  We bought the one with the sound but have not used that feature yet. Would've been pointless at a noisy dance but we will use it halloween night. He was the hit of the party. I have to admit I'm dying to try it on. Would definitely buy it again.

  I received what was clearly someone's (possibly used) returned item, that was jammed halfway into the open package and covered with lint and threads. (So much for quality control and presenting the customer with a fresh/new looking item).Although It seemed to be well made and of decent quality, the costume itself was about two sizes too small.I am not happy with the idea of returning it and having to pay a restocking fee, simply to have the chance to try it on. That is lousy customer service!

  Going by the measurements provided for sizing, the costume I ordered ended up being a little bit too big. But I would rather it be too big than too small.

I would have liked some more things (maybe some fake nails and screws etc). A few tips:tip 1: Don't remove the tools when wearing the costume.

  My husband is 6'1, 180lbs and bought a medium. He probably would've fit better in a small. We crisscrossed the straps in back because they were really long. The shorts were baggy, but that didn't really bug him. He bought different socks because the ones that came with it were thigh highs. Costume also looked great without the white shirt, but he ended up with nipple chaffing by the end of the night, lol. Despite the costume not fitting perfectly, he got a million compliments on his costume. Definitely worth the money.

  Although this costume it labeled as fitting ""Adult - Standard"" for the size, most adults will probably have a hard time wearing this properly.  I'm not overly tall being a 5'11"" tall male but when I put this on, the feet end up just below my knees (see picture).  This is disappointing, especially being a product that is supposed to be endorsed by the movie franchise.  In my opinion, you'd have to be closer to 5' tall for this to fit correctly.The first one I bought through Walmart (it was cheaper than on Amazon), but returned it due to the feet being just below my knees...so I thought it was just defective.  So I bought one from Amazon, but it's the same way - too short!  The leg inseam to the costumes elastic ankle is only about 12 inches.  Now if I had narrower shoulders, I might have been able to pull my head and shoulders up into the costumes head area some more & possibly gotten the feet closer to mine.  But it's sized in typical Chinese dimensions, so everything is smaller than what is considered ""normal"" here.I still like the overall concept and look of the costume, so I'll just modify it to fit in my spare time instead of try and return it for a second time.

  I debated on this costume for a week before I purchased it. I read reviews, checked size charts, made SURE I ordered the right size. It came today and it’s tiny! I’m 5’4 and 170lbs... someone else wrote a review saying they were 5’4 180lbs and she ordered an xl, so I ordered an xl as well. I USUALLY WEAR A LARGE! This thing is SO small that my 12 year old fits in it! (My daughter is the one in the pic). I couldn’t even zip it up. I’m going to be livid if they charge me a restocking fee like they did others. Now it’s too late to return and order this in another size for it to be here by Halloween. What’s the point of sizing if it’s completely inaccurate??

  I'm 36dd, 185#, 5'7"". It was about 3 inches too short which made arms extremely tight and shoulders pull down. Leggings fit well. Flattering if you can get back to zip. Impossible to do alone in bathroom breaks as the whole costume needs to come off. Wear black bra and undies as it's a bit sheer- maybe even body shaper under it. Made for smaller chested women. Of appearance in the chest area- the lines for across the nips due to me being fuller on that area and tall but are designed to go under bust line.  Will need push up bra for advertised cleavage effect. Fabric flimsy and came with rip at bottom of the zipper buy couldnt return for exchange since they were out of Large when i tried.

I wore it to my bartending job, and wore a black tank top under as the bust area is pretty revealing, but I would have felt comfortable without the tank top had I been wearing it to a party or out for the night . Quality of fabric was better then I expected, and I had no issues after washing it.

  I am happy with this costume. I like that it has a zipper. I was most hesitant when trying to figure out what size to order. I am no tailor, but I will include some measurements to help the next person decide on the best size.Also the tag specifies to hand wash cold. Only non-chlorine bleach when needed, Line dry, Do not iron. I haven't washed it yet.I'll start by saying that my daughter is 4 years old and about 41 inches tall. I measured her chest at 22 inches and she weighs about 41 pounds. She typically wears a size 5 in little girls clothing. According to the size chart it would have recommended I buy the S/P size for ages 4 to 6. I decided to go up a size and by the medium recommended for ages 7 to 10, and I'm glad I did. The next size down probably would have fit fine, but I'm happy with the extra room at this size.The medium (7-10) costume measurements I took are (approximately)...The  arm and chest length when my daughter held her arms out while wearing it is about 37 inches all the way from from cuff to cuff.The zipper is 21inches long.The seam from the armpit to the cuff is 12 inches.I am trying to add photos, but can't seem to right now.

  Ordered this because in the description it said it came with the leg warmers. It was more expensive that the ones that did not come with leg warmers and that is why I went with this one. The packaging did not list the leg warmers and there were none in the package. Very disappointed that the description and the end product differ. Now I have to spend more on socks.

  I was really disappointed in this. Living in Las Vegas, we don't get as cold as most places. In this case, if it had even fit, I would not have been able to wear it. It was hot!!! I tried it on indoors (with the a/c running mind you) and instantly started burning up. Not only was it too big, but without holding your arms out, I didn't feel like it even resembled a bat.

  I wish that one washing wouldn't make the seams pull away from the reflector strips. Make sure you always put the velcro closures together when washing, and/or use a laundry bag so it doesn't pull at the strings on the rest of the jacket or other laundry.

  Its almost like a thick sweatshirt, was definitely warm for wearing to go take my son out trick or treating.  The body was a little snug for a large, but it is supposed to be fitted.  I wore leggings under it, as I felt it would be too short as a dress otherwise, and I'm only 5'3"".  Also, trying to get it to lay right with the hood up was hard, but people commented it was cute (though I think because my baby had a similar costume on), and most of the time I could keep it down and be comfortable.  The wings are the sleeves, and actually done well enough you could use your arms and not have the extra fabric get in the way.  I washed it (came out fine) and put it away to use again in the future.

  I ordered a medium, it was pretty tight but I thought it was perfect. Im around 150 pounds I thought the medium fit me great. I got so many compliments. It’s a little thin but not see through. It’s so stretchy and durable I washed it twice and it didn’t affect it at all. I loved this costume. The red sash also cover the little pouch I have on my belly so thumbs up to that. The top is a little low but I don’t have a big bust so it was great for me I just wore a low cut black bralette under it. The only downfall was the red ties didn’t stay up they kept falling down my legs I just used pins to hold them up other than that it was sexy yet not to revealing. I would recommend to anyone!

  The costume itself is nice -- fit as expected, comfortable, decent quality. However, the dress I received smells really bad of body odor. It's as if someone bought it, wore it and returned it... and then it was sent to me. The smell is noticeable as soon as you open the bag. I would normally give this 4 stars but had to give 3 simply because it smells awful and has to be washed before it's worn.

  hello my fellow amazon friends, As mush as I wanted this dinosaur costume to be a big hit it was a big disappointment. I hate to be the person who give this wonderful costume a ONE STAR but, I purchased the costume for a dinosaur theme party that I hosted for my son's  4TH Birthday. The shipment was right on time package came well packed and looked as expected but when I went to try it on it felt a bit small and I'm only 5'3 but as I proceeded I believed once it started to inflate it that issue would go away but unfortunately that never happen, why you ask? Well it seemed that the fan wasn't strong enough to keep it inflated even with brand new batteries hopefully something could be done. the saddest part was all the children kept asking whats wrong with T-Rex i was very disappointed.

  I read many reviews which helped me with sizing. My son who is 12 fit just fine in an adult size, had it been any smaller it would not have fit. I purchased three, one for myself and two for my kids.  The wow factor was great, lots of compliments and laughs and Jurassic World jokes. However getting around in these costumes proved problematic. You become over heated- so I recommend wearing a tank top and shorts- or something equivalent.  If you have long hair, put it in a bun, lots of static electricity in the head portion. The part of the costume where you see out fogs up a lot. We used these to trick or treat, and were exhausted by the time we came home. The kids did less then half of the houses they usually would do just simply do to the cumbersome nature of the costume and the continual fogging issue. However, with all that being said, these are fun costumes to wear- just not long term.

  Jacket is a good quality material and the hat is sturdy with an adjustable band that sometimes falls out.  Fits our 4 year old well.  The Bull horn just plays a siren noise (we were hoping for a megaphone effect - not a big deal).  The fire extinguisher sprays water as a squeeze bottle, but the nozzle was poorly constructed and sprays everywhere when sprayed.  The sticker on the fire extinguisher was also very cheap and came off the first time it was exposed to water.

  My 4 year old firefighter loves it! The name tag adds a special touch with room also for a small ID photo. I expected it to be paper but it's plastic like a credit card. The horn takes 2 triple A batteries and the sound is realistic like a fire siren but surprisingly not terribly loud. The extinguisher is light weight and has no sounds or anything which is fine. The jacket closes with velcro. It is light weight but not cheap feeling at all. The reflective material is functional and realistic. I do wish it was a little bigger, sleeves longer, as it now fits my 4 year old perfectly but my son is taller and comparison in size to a 5 or 6 year old. It's going to make a great Halloween costume paired with the firefighter rain boots I bought on Amazon and black pants.

  This is a really cute monkey jacket. Ordered a medium for my 11 yr old who is about 4'10"" tall. She is very slim. This fits her very snugly down the body with not so much wiggle room although the material gives a little stretch, so I don't think this would fit an average adult female unless she's very skinny with a 24"" waist. Absolutely love the tail and ears on the hood. Very cute n my daughter loves it.  I had to return the first time bc there was open seams on the tail. Quick exchange which I'm happy about so I had time to go costume shopping if this didn't work out. Second one had some messy stitching detail but at least it wasn't infringing on actual costume or making any open seams worst. Overall, very happy with monkey jacket.

  This is possibly the best costume I've ever purchased. Most costumes are single-use quality, but the quality of this is fantastic. The detail & patches are authentic and I also bought the Pete Mitchell/Maverick dog tags to go with my costume. I threw on my aviators and went to an 80's themes birthday party where there was Marty McFly, Andre Agassi, Axl Rose, and dozens of other stars of the 80's....and I won the costume contest with this! I hung it in the closet and will definitely be using it again in the future. This is the only costume I have ever fully recommended, which says a lot because I'm picky about quality and being a Top Gun fan, I'm a stickler for details...and this was worth the $$!I'm 6ft, 224lbs and the Medium/Large fit well...especially the arm & leg lengths. The crotch area was a bit snug and bending over/sitting down wasn't really possible, but it was never really ""uncomfortable"".

  I bought this for my son for a halloween costume. I was worried that it would not fit him because he is a small 3 year old (36"" and 28 lbs)and i could not find any sizing in the description. I was impressed with the costume and the quality. I had to roll up the sleeves a little bit (which did not look akward or bulky) and the jacket is slightly long, but he looks too darling in it and we got a lot of complements. the bonus was the little toys that come with it...they just attach to the jacket, so he did not have to carry it in hand while carrying his bag of candy. I did not put batteries in the megaphone thing because i read in the reviews that it was annoying, so i did not EVEN show that to my son...he just pretended to shout in it. it's worth the $$--he always wants to play with all that stuff on. the hat is adjustable, which is a plus since I can never find hats that fit his large cranium. good buy.

  This is a great costume set for a boy or girl. My girl wanted it for career day at school. Comes with great instruments, very sturdy and easy for little hands to work on their ""patients"". It has held up very nicely with two kids using it several times a week for wild playroom play. Have not washed it yet but imagine it would do fine on gentle, cold water, and hang to dry.

For starters I'm 5'5, 150 pounds, with a 36D bust and I ordered a small. The mesh part of the costume stretches, so it wasn't uncomfortably tight or anything!

  My daughter likes this costume because it is basically a fleece jacket with wings. We added glow in the dark glitter glue to the edges and spines of the wings so they would show up better. I bought the glow in the dark glitter glue from Hobby Lobby. Just be warned, if you need to wash it the glitter glue washes off. It'll be warm at least if Halloween is as cold as last year. Fits her a little big but room for clothes underneath.

  Where to begin with this gem. This was the 3rd t-Rex I bought. I now have a family of t-Rex outfits, and suffice to say we stole the show for our Halloween party. I will say, you have to be on the shorter side of life in order for this to fit. There is plenty of room once inside, but getting in can be a bit tedious. Don't expect to eat, or drink while wearing this. It stays surprisingly cool as well, as there is a constant intake of fresh air. If you can find it for a great price, I'd snatch it up. I have seen this fluctuate from $50 to over $200.

  The item was exactly as described. The gloves are a little big but otherwise it looked great! Definitely pair it up with fishnets and boots since it is not included. Item arrived on time but took a while to ship. They said she would ship in 2-3 days but they did not. BUT IT STILL arrived on time somehow even though it was also delayed by Hurricane Sandy since I live in NJ. Overall satisfied.

  After going to school one day and getting to play dress up in a police uniform just like this, my son would NOT stop talking about getting one when he got home. We already had the M&D fireman costume, and it has held up very well, so we went ahead and ordered this one as well. This is a great price for it, and my son LOVES putting it on and wearing it around the house. Thanks for encouraging fun, imaginative play!My son is almost 6, about 44/45 inches tall, and about 42 pounds, and this fits him pretty well, but there is definitely room for him to wear it for another good year at least.

  Great costume, especially with the Ms wearing the matching Leg Ave womans version. Fit great! Best part is you just pull if over whatever you are wearing (as compared to the little dress female version). Halloween this year was exceptionally cold, but all was good with this costume just pulling it over a sweatshirt and jeans.

  Quality wasn't bad. Unfortunately I had a bit of a difficult time with sizing on this one. While my arms fit well in a Large, my torso is definitely more like a Medium. Ended up needing to take in the sides of this in order for it to fit better and look less boxy. The shirt is a button-up. The tie is simply an elastic band that you put under the collar The skirt is VERY short and strapped on with velcro. Overall, it was a fun costume. I'd say give it a try

  Very easy to put on as the black fabric has a lot of give and is basically a one piece suit. No buttons or zippers which also helps with it fitting like a glove.  The black tulle of the skirt has quite a bit of stiffness to it so it keeps the shape beautifully yet five is a beautiful bounce when my toddle walks.  Another, older girl asked me how does the skirt do that with great admiration in her eyes.The only thing that is a bit sub par are the ears - not awful though.  Obviously Minnie Mouse has black one with a bow but even if we put that aside they look a bit cheap: foam circles about 1/4 of an inch thick covered in fabric.

  This was hilarious,  we showed Jurassic Park as a drive-in movie at the fair grounds.  We had the right person with the greatest personality get in the suit.  At the beginning of the movie we had “Rex” handing out free bottles of flavored water to all the vehicles coming in..  During the movie, rex occasionally strolled through the rows of cars...keeping a safe distance of course.  Then when it came time to leave we gave Rex two traffic flashlights and he directed traffic....dancing all the time!  The suit was great.  It even made our Rex person walk comical.  We may only get to use this one time.... but the laughs were worth the purchase price.

  I looked at a number of bee costumes on Amazon and this was one of the most expensive BUT reading the descriptions of the others, it looked like they were vinyl apron-like garments that tie off at the shoulders. This one is a fabric (though a very cheap knitted fabric) shirt/tunic made to be worn over a long-sleeved shirt.  It also comes with the leggings, a nice touch. It is VERY roomy!  I am 5'8"" tall & 175 lbs and it is very large on me, though not a problem because I didn't get it to look sexy.  I would have given it 5 stars, except the headband with the antennae is very poorly put together & guaranteed to break before the Halloween party is over. One of the antennae was detached before I even got it out of the package. I didn't send it back because I was able to reinforce it adequately with a black pipe cleaner. So - 1 star for poor antenna design/quality control. I completed the costume with a pair of the bee-eyes glasses, a black long-sleeved T shirt, and a pair of black leggings.

  Perhaps one of the best costumes I've purchases on amazon ever.disclaimers:1. size is everything. I got a medium so it would be tight. it was. like ZERO room for error. I am 5'11"", athletic build, 30""-31"" waist, 175, and i have broad shoulders for my size. If you can pull this costume off (thank you TRX every day and rock climbing), do it.2. beware kids. even at a superhero gathering, kids actually thought I was Spiderman. (it's that good).3. the seams are what you'd expect, but I was still able to climb a rock wall, jump  over a ball pit barrier, and dance. try it on a few times, you will notice where the seams will start to pull if you have it ""properly"" tight. then just sew. there is an oddly placed one inch seam below the zipper and just over your tailbone. maybe to give room when you sit down (like in a car.... TEST THIS FIRST before going to your holiday party!). one little safety pin will do.4. the feet are narrow for the height of the costume. I wear an 11-12 and often wide. that is the MOST this can fit.5. roll this costume up slowly, getting every last bit of stretch out of it as you put it on. you will thank me. without this procedure, it didn't reach the (top of my inseam) and left a space, WITH this procedure, perfect fit and right to the top of my inseam.6. the zippers. if you have ANY chest or back to speak of, the zipper requires a friends help OR get a key chain necklace with a hook on one end and use that to pull it up. once it's on, it's easy to pull it down to the neck and show your head. but the costume is pretty good if you want to stay incognito.7. shockingly not too warm and not cold. like second skin. wore outside at first party til 9-10 PM (San Francisco) and inside at a hot club til closing. no issues.

  I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who is crazy about all things ""fireman"" ever since a ""Real"" fireman came for a talk at his school.  I wanted to get him a good quality firemans outfit, not cheap plastic, and the Melissa & Doug Fire Chief Role Play Costume Set came with a polyester/nylon coat that is heavyweight and actually can be worn as a jacket.  It is washable by hand or machine washable on delicates and cold.  The Bullhorn actually works with two AA alkaline batteries (he pushes the button on it and it makes a siren sound.  Unfortunately it does NOT actually function as a working bullhorn, which would have been MUCH better) and the ""fire extinguisher"" is not flimsy, neither is the plastic hat.  My grandson was so crazy about the outfit that he slept in the coat for several nights straight.  A REAL hit!The Fire Extinguisher and Bullhorn attach to the coat on the velcro waist strap.

  I’m not sure of the material but it’s a HOT (temperature) costume at least for fall weather in San Diego. Although I got compliments on the cuteness it bunches up in the front by the zipper even with a XL size. I wore leggings underneath as it was too short for my liking as I’m a very curvy woman. But it’s a cute costume and I haven’t see anything like it in the stores.

  Best investment I’ve made all year! The best costume for your Pj mask lover! It is a very thin material but don’t overlook that. This is the one time your going to want it! My toddler plays until he passes out which usually ends up with him getting so hot and sweaty he has a melt down and strips off his clothes! But this costume is so light and breathable he can wear it all day. I have to basically spray him down with a hose he loves it so much and refuses to take it off! It’s been around 6 months so he has now outgrown it and it has become tattered but I will definitely repurchase!!!

  The costume is true to size, has very bright colors and is made of soft material flexible enough for little kids movement. The only problem was the order seemed to be missing the wings and wand. However, the costume is truly cute on its own. Head piece is a bit heavy on the forehead so babies need to be standing tall to support it upwards.

  Two stars for vibrant colors...and that's about the only positive thing about this costume. I ordered a ladies size medium and this jumpsuit was just barely long enough for my 12yo daughter at 5'1"" and was almost too tight throughout the body and legs...she is 110 lbs. So the sizing definitely runs small. The seam holding the ""belt"" to the ""shirt"" came apart. For no known or apparent reason...the pants had several different runs in them just as you would find in panty hose. The hat was bent terribly because of the way it wad packaged.

  I was expecting to get the teen version thinking it would be between a child and an adult size since I’m 5’2. It was way to too small and they sent me the child size instead. The picture kind of mislead me thinking there would be plastic where the face was, but there was a hole cut out to show the face. I put it on my little brother who was 4’1 and it fit him perfectly though! The head hole for it was too small so we did have to cut it for him, but overall it aired up and everything.If you’re wondering how it fit me in a child’s size, the feet part went up to my thigh and the gloves with it were a bit snug. I was disappointed because it was supposed to be my Halloween costume, but my lil bro enjoyed it instead. So if your over 4’8, get the adult size!

  This is a fantastic gift for a 5 year old, especially one that enjoys playing dress-up. We purchased this for our nephew, who has recently started getting excited about dress-up. He loved that this came with lots of tools – a stethoscope, shot, mask, jacket, name-tag, and a couple of other cool doctor tools. Some of them click and do something when played with, which he loved, and the stethoscope makes a heart beat sound when it's button is depressed (and batteries are added). Because this is much more than just a costume – it has all of the fun accessories with it that look real enough to a 5 year old – it is a really exciting toy. We thought this would be something he would play with for 5 minutes, but he spent an hour with it the first night he got it, doctoring everyone willing to sit for him. He called us a few days later (with assistance, of course), and he threatened to make a house call if we didnt come to see him for our appointment right then. We heard he dressed up and continued to play doctor to all visitors who came to the house over this past weekend. Who knows how long he'll continue to play with it, but he's already gotten so much time out of it and was so excited about it from the start, that we are so happy with the gift.We should mention that he did have an accident earlier this year and had to go to the ER for a few hours to get stitched up, and it was especially exciting to him to be able to play the role of doctor, after having that stressful but stimulating experience.

  Not as described. The ascot and arms are blue, not white. Now trying to find face paint to match as the white I already purchased won't work. The wig is made of yarn, I ordered a higher quality one.  I was surprised at the low quality of the costume as it is a licensed product. Very thin and not well made. The Velcro dots that close the ascot are marginally  attached. Pieces were scattered in the box, the plastic bag it should have been contained in was torn at multiple places. Had to be placed in the box that way as the shipping box was in perfect shape. Should have just sent it back, but time is running out for when I need it, so I will just improvise where I can.

  This dress is beautiful, good quality fabric and the glitter doesn't fall and scatter every where. the size was perfect. I ordered a size up so she can wear it longer, however, the dress had a awful smell of chemicals. I washed on a delicate cycle and that took care of the smell. The dress washed good, no shrinkage, fading or tears. I let it air-dry. All the little accessories are cheap and will probably break before she leaves the house.

  I was so pleased with this costume for my almost 5 year old son! My son decided he wanted to be a ""spooky bat"" for Halloween and when browsing for a costume to buy, I didn't look at this at first because I was turned off by the stockings/overall styling of the photo. It's really just a nice big fleece hoodie! So easy to put on and you can easily layer if you need to for a very cold Halloween. My son loved it and he got tons of compliments from his friends at school and his friends' parents loved it too. My son is very tall for his age and I struggled with what size to get but thanks to some other reviews I selected a size medium. It was a great fit! Big enough for layering and for him to be able to wear for a while but it didn't look too large on him either. For other clothing he normally wears 5T or boys size 6 for tops. I hope Amazon adds some additional photos of the hoodie by itself and on other kids (both boys and girls!) so it isn't so misleading as it is now with the current photo.

  Not very well made. The Velcro straps in the back constantly catch onto the costume itself, and tears the fabric. The masks are also huge.

  I bought this for pure unadulterated fun.  I'm a 54 year old woman and have wanted one of these for a couple of years.  I have worn it for several occasions and it was a blast.  My sisters loved mine so much, they bought one too.  Mine has a growling module in the palm of one of the gloves which was great.  The kids love this and the laughter is pure golden.  When you wear it, the legs really start at your own knees and the head extends about 2 feet above your own.  Vision is clear through the screen in the neck and movement is easy.  Remember, you're a mighty meat eating thundering T-Rex in this costume, but you also have the arms of a T-Rex, so don't expect to have a wide range of motion.  You will love this costume and have a blast.  I was NOT hot even though I wore this in the summer time.  One thought - use good batteries because the fan HAS to keep this inflated for you to have success.  Your costume will also NOT stay inflated if you don't have your arms in the sleeves and elastic around your wrists/arms so that air doesn't escape.  I'm sure this can be punctured but I was on the street, in the grass and even climbed a tree without damage.  The neighbors love this too.  Who doesn't love a T-Rex?

  I was so excited when I got this costume in the mail! I did look at reviews so I went for the large. I have a fairly athletic build and I'm 5'5, a C, and 133lbs. It fits just fine and feels like I ordered a large(not my normal size, realized I put med in my original review for some reason so I changed it) and was glad I did. It ends just above my knees, so it may shorten your steps a bit. I could definitely get another layer underneath there but not much else since it is pretty much form hugging. It is pretty warm. The fin lands at the bottom of my butt and there are elbow fins that are at my elbows. The hood isn't too bad, I have very thick hair, so it should be normal fitting for all. The teeth and eyes were stitched just fine. If I were to say anything bad, I guess I agree about the zipper bunching, but it's honestly not even that huge a deal...look at the costume, lol.

  I was expecting this to be a great buy, but I am blown away at how great of quality this is! My son was so happy when I opened this up. The packaging is great. I plan to keep the hanger and clear package that was over it to protect it. I would say the fit is a big, but my son is small (wears 2T or 3T clothes and he’s about to be 4) so I am fine with that. I would recommend this to anyone!

  I absolutely love this costume! So sexy and fits the curves well. I am usually a medium in costumes but from reading other reviews that said to size down, I bought both the small and the medium to see and the small definitely fit me better. It hugged my curves on the booty and looked great in the chest. Also the peplum skirt hides the tummy area which I love. Looks great! Only thing I didn’t love too much was the hat. It’s really small on the head and falls flat. Looks kinda funny on my head lol but overall the costume is well-made and I am definitely glad I purchased this.

  I am super irritated about this. The item came damaged. Upon opening I noticed how wrinkled it was but oh well I thought I can steam it out. Had my daughter try it on for size and that when I noticed there’s a huge stain on the side of the dress like someone had worn it and spilled something all down one side of the dress and sleeves. Plus the back of the dress was defective with some of the gold foiling on the back. Horrible! The tags are still on it but it’s obviously been worn!!

  My son loves this costume!  He used it for his Halloween costume, and he likes to wear it when he is playing like a construction worker.  He is 6 and tall for his age, but the vest and helmet still fit him.  (The safety goggles are a bit small for him, though.)  The vest looks very much like what a real construction worker would wear, and we have found that the reflective tape on it makes it useful for nighttime outings or bike rides, too.  The hard hat has adjustable plastic bands inside to make it fit more snugly for different head sizes, which is nice.  The only problems I see with it are that the adjustable bands tend to come apart from the hard hat so the little pegs have to be stuck back into it every so often, and the hammer and saw that came with it tend to fall out of the pockets easily due to the pockets not being deep enough.  However, the tools were one of the things my son liked best about this costume, and they have been fun for him anyway.

I'm only giving 4 stars because the fire helmet has the adjustment band inside that has tabs the hold it in place. I found myself constantly reinserting them during the evening because they kept slipping out causing the helmet to flop all over the place. It's nothing that a little glue can't fix.

  After reading reviews that said the fit was small or as expected, I decided to order a small anyway. I’m 5’1” 110lbs and based on the chart provided the brand suggested a small. The sleeves are perfect if not a smidge short - but it doesn’t bother me. Otherwise it fits great and looks cute. I’d say if you typically wear a small and you like a tight fit, then order a small. Otherwise if you’re inbetween it might be best to go one size up to have more room.  I was worried with the costume that even with the arms down you wouldn’t be able to tell what it is, but that’s not the case. It’s cute and I think it will keep me warm.

  I purchased this for my 4 year old for Halloween. He's 43 inches tall and wears size 5/6 clothing, and it fits him perfectly with room to grow. The jacket is extremely well-made, the hat is thick plastic and doesn't bend (he tested this, by standing on it). The bullhorn is awesome and thankfully isn't very loud. The bullhorn and fire extinguisher can be velcroed to the outside of the jacket. I feel like this will last for a long time, totally worth the money and I've already purchased more outfits from this brand.

  The plan for my son's 13th birthday was to go to Washington DC for the tour of the capital that he's too medically fragile to take with his class. Then came the pandemic. Travel plans canceled, I needed a gift that would be an adequate consolation for the trip... and since he's been telling me how much he really wanted a plague mask, and I didn't have time to make one, I went looking online.Long story short: This was PERFECT. It's not flimsy or uncomfortable, fits well, and has just the right look... without being overly expensive. Made him really, really happy (and he appreciated the irony of getting a plague mask during a pandemic).

  First, let's talk the fit. It was perfect.I am 5'8 tall and weigh 160 Lbs. I wear a size 10 in ""regular clothes"", sometimes an 8.I bought the Size Large Costume and it was perfect for my height and ""larger"" body.The red sash covers the middle so you can set it up in whatever way you feel best. I bought some Ninja Sais and tucked those into the red sash and I looked very authentic!The costume material is actually good quality. It did not rip, tear or lose its shape. The black provides a slimming effects and holds in those loose ends. I get nervous about "" catsuits"" but this one made me feel confident and secure. I wore for a party and it was the best. I did not worry about feeling fat all night or pulling and tugging at straps or a short skirt.Even so, I still received lots of positive feedback from my costume. I am actually going to just handwash it and wear it again for another party coming up.Important Points:Have a decent undergarment for the bust. The cleavage is cut low so be prepared to work with it if you have to wear a bra .My bra kept showing all night but that was my fault for not having the right bra. I will not make that mistake on this next party.Also, other buyers mention the straps on the arms and legs coming off and falling down all night. I did not have this issue. On the pants I actually took red thread and sewed the straps directly onto the leg. I just wrapped the straps up the leg firmly like the photo and then held them in place and sewed it on at random points. All night long, the straps stayed perfectly in place. For the arms, I did the same and on one I just wrapped it up the arm and then put a safety pin at the top. Worked like a charm. The straps stayed in place even with my dancing around and being crazy and acrobatic. You can do the same for the sash, so the sash doesn't keep spinning and moving around. If you follow those steps you should not any issue with the arm or leg straps falling and the material does not get ""ruined"" by putting pins in it or sewing onto it so sew away. Its pretty resilient.

  My 3 year old was looking forward to this for a couple of days before it arrived. The night ended in more tears than anything else, both for him and us. Others have commented on the horribly inadequate hat insert. This is an understatement. Sizing the hat down is not possible, it will not stay. Although it looks like similar to a resizable ball cap with pins and holes, the pins are smooth cylinders, not t-shaped or nubed like a ball cal so they do not snap into the holes. The slightest bit of movement and the hat adjustments pop loose. Or worse the whole inset comes off. Some kids don't mind, take the insert out and the hat flops around looking cute. My son knows it's important to wear his bicycle helmet on snug, so all helmets and hats now need to be snug. Frankly this hat ruins the whole experience and not at all what we expect from a Melissa & Doug product.

So I decided to return that and instead went with the 6/6x. It's roomy in the bodice for her to grow into and the length doesn't appear to be a huge difference between the two sizes. She's not swimming in it, but has room to grow. It's too gorgeous not to have for a few years. Must Buy!!

  My daughter is a little fashionista/princess.  She loves this one.  The quality is great!  With other dresses with the wide shoulder look, I felt like the dress it's self kept slipping down too low.  This has a mesh that goes over he shoulders- so it stays up and is comfortable.  She's not having to readjust it over and over again.  I did buy it a size bigger than she needed, but that was intentional. Kids grow so fast, and I wanted for her to be able to wear it for a year.  I am glad I did- it's a little big, but she'll get to use it for at least a year- if not 18 months.

  I'm a busty woman, 38DD. The shirt was to small. I think even if I got a bigger size, the shirt iwould have still been tight on me. Not a big deal, I purchased another at my local store. As far as the skirt, I have wide hips. The skirt didn't fit around my hips but I didn't care about that. I wrapped the skirt (it's velcrow) around my waist covering belly button & it fit perfect & it showed just the right amt of my bottom as I wanted. The tie fit perfect around my neck. You just slide it over your head. The glasses came w/ no frame. I think the discription stated that. Overall, I love the outfit. The shirt was the only thing that wouldn't fit do to me being busty. It's still worth the purchase.

  I bought this for my 5-year old nephew and he loves it! He put the costume on immediately upon opening the gift and then didn't take it off all day. He's a small little 5-year-old and the jacket was a tad too big but he didn't mind and he'll have room to grow now.Down sides of this is the megaphone piece doesn't stay in the belt very well so it's constantly falling out. Also, the hat is pretty cheap and no matter what we did, it was way too big for his head and wouldn't stay on. Still really cute and he loved it all the same.

I am a B cup and the chest part was slightly big to where it shifted a little but nothing was hanging out. Also it was delivered much faster than expected (i think within one week).

Would have returned this costume but considering that my husband and I have a theme for our Halloween party, I did not have enough time to order another costume to have it home in time for the party.

  I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this. I didn't realize until I got it that the entire back is one large piece of pink fabric (which, by the way, is NOT shown with the product image like it should be). I ended up cutting it in half and sewing the front pattern from the bottom half to the back of the top half to make a shirt and cover up the pink. The wig was unwearable. The yarn was too thick and clumped in patches. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a more suitable Sally outfit.

  I'm giving it a 2-star because they increased the price almost $5 when I processed a return and reship.  I purchased a medium per the online chart  however it was  to small.  Overall the costume is a good choice.  The vest fits a little different (bulky) and might require some modification.  The gloves are vinyl and fit a little bulky too, making it difficult to handle things.  I would still recommend the costume.  I'm just a little bitter the seller increased the purchase price to cover the shipping cost.

  My wife and I share this Amazon account, so I will allow her to offer her thoughts on this product since she bought it for herself. But first, I will say that the level of sheer joy in our home exponentially increased moments after she donned the costume and inflated it fully. Here she is:Want to know how to shake things up in an Infantry Division during 0630 PT Formation? Order this costume and show up to terrorize the lazy out of some Privates!I'll admit, when I picked the package up from our mailroom I was a bit nervous. It was small and seemed like it wouldn't possible be large enough to fit. Before I even opened the package I checked my order history on Amazon to make sure I didn't accidentally order the costume for children. I didn't. I was ready to have to return the costume as I tore open the package, but was pleasantly surprised to find an adult-sized t-Rex inside.Getting the costume on took some work. I don't recommend wearing boot-cut jeans under it for two reasons: first, the feet of the costume are open on the bottom so you can wear shoes without wearing the bottom of the costume out by walking on the material of it. To keep the airflow from escaping through the foot area, the ankles are elastic... and that elastic is pretty snug. If you're wearing boot-cut jeans, there is a lot of material to get the elastic around. I was able to get the elastic over the jeans with some careful manipulation, but the ensuing bunching of the boot-cut jeans made for a pretty tight squeeze.I was worried about how thin the material of the costume is. We live in South Korea, and the temperatures are getting down in the high 20s (F). With a fan blowing air around the inside of the costume, and 20*+ weather outside, I was nervous that the costume would be miserably cold to be in. On the contrary! I was warm and close to sweating after wearing the costume inside our 68* apartment for less than ten minutes. This comes back to the second reason boot-cut jeans may not be a great idea. Go for something a bit thinner... maybe running capri pants?I have only worn the costume for a silly 20 minutes in our apartment to see how it fits and how it works. For your reference, I am a 5'9"" curvy woman of 190 pounds and it fits well once it's on. Getting it on took a little bit of manipulation because there is no stretch to the material (specifically, putting my arms in the armholes after having my legs in completely). It wasn't a huge struggle... and I was able to don the costume by myself, but I will say that the costume does take a small amount of thought to put it on.I intend to wake some Soldiers up at PT in the morning in this costume. After doing so, I'll post an update to this review to reflect my thoughts. As of right now, this looks to be a wonderfully sturdy, hilariously fun costume. I can't wait to see what shenanigans we can make with this fellah!

  It has got to be the goofiest looking things when you start walking in it, the head flops back and you end up looking like an overly excited toddler. I saw a video of someone wearing this costume re-enacting a Jurassic Park scene on YouTube, and right then, I knew I had to have it. Putting the costume on for the first time was a bit of a challenge. you have to put your head and arms in first, and then put your legs in. Only complaint, my wife is leaving me because I haven't taken it off for 3 weeks now.

  I'm 5'5 and 123 lbs. I bought the size small (7-9), and if fit as I expected. It has no shape but there are ties in the back that you can use to make it more fitted. Unfortunately for me, the placement of those ties were way below my natural waistline so I didn't use them. I actually just ended up cutting them off. The back of the dress is all one solid color of light pink and is very sheer. If you wear the dress loosely, though, it may not look so sheer. Overall, I'm satisfied with the costume and glad I bought it. I also didn't use the wig as others have posted. It was too thin so I bought a different one.

  Just the other day I was telling someone how Melissa & Doug products are first-rate, and now I have to eat my words.The doctor's suit is great -- my son (3 y.o.) looks so cute in it.  When he opened it on Christmas morning, he gave a big thumbs-up, and exulted, ""yes!""  Just what a parent wants to hear!  He doesn't hang it up, though, and I've noticed it's starting to get a bit wrinkled.  I can't see him ironing it....I'm disappointed with the tools, though -- they're just not up to the Melissa & Doug standard I've come to expect.  The stethoscope in particular is flimsy plastic and I'm afraid it's going to break in no time.  It didn't work with the first set of batteries (2 x AAA) I put in because the springs don't contact the negative terminal when I put the lid back on.  I needed to get a different brand of batteries where the negative terminal extends over the entire end cap of the battery.  The other tools are reasonable (the ear scope is also a bit flimsy, but better than the stethoscope).Despite my reservations, my son loves it, and has had it on a few times, and it's only the day after Christmas.

  I bought this for my 12 year old son, who asked for a Slytherin robe. It isn't too big, so I would say it fits smaller than expected. It is very plush and soft and cozy. I would describe it as a bathrobe or lounge wear, not as a costume.

  I bought myself this outfit and my fiancé the male outfit and boy did we look good!! I was so satisfied!! We added shotgun ammo belts to add a bit of a more military look to it and I made sure we wore Aviator Sunglasses. We got so many compliments and his sister even said she'd probably want to borrow our outfits for next years Halloween! Some kid at the grocery store thought I was an actual fighter pilot and went and told his dad hahaha. Anyways, the only thing I didn't like was the sewing in the middle going down toward the crotch. The thread came out a little bit BUT didn't cause anything to unhem all the way or anything. I have a smaller torso and am petite so I had to pull the leg part down and made it JUST a little baggy so that it would look good on the top. Again, my fiancé and I were super satisfied. I wish I could wear it all the time lol. But we have to earn our badges the right way! (:

  I purchased this set mainly for the hard hat.  It was very cheaply made and the adjustable band inside would not stay in the hat.  the adjustable strap could be made larger, but it was very limited on how small it could be made.  There were several tabs that snapped into holes to keep the adjustable band inside the hat.  One of these tabs was the wrong size so it did not fit all the way into the hole causing the adjustable band to come loose easily at that point.  I am afraid that this will cause the adjustable band to eventually be lost from the hat.  The pockets that were provided for the hammer and saw were too shallow, causing the saw and hammer to easily fall out of the pockets provided for them.  The safety glasses had a velcro connection at the back of the head but it would have been nice to have a sliding adjustment at the point where the elastic attached to the glasses. I would have gladly paid more for a more quality product.  I remember my daughter once telling me that Melissa and Doug toys are always well made.  I did not find that to be the case on this toy.  Frankly, I would have liked to send it back, however my 2 year old grandson would not have understood why Grandma did not let him keep his new outfit.

  ReliBeauty really makes the best costume dresses for little kids. They are gorgeous, fully lined in cotton lining so nothing is itchy against your child's skin (for the sensitive ones like mine), even the sleeves are a soft chiffon type material, not that itchy fishnet mesh you can get on the cheaper factory costumes. Mine even held up to a gentle/hand wash cycle in the washing machine (not sure if that's recommended but my daughter wore it to school and spilled lunch on it). We didn't even lose a sequin and the stains came out with only Woolite! This is the 3rd princess dress I have purchased from ReliBeauty and finally left review because they are that awesome. We have Rapunzel, Belle and now Aurora. I'm sure we will be adding to the collection soon. You can't go wrong. Worth twice the money!

  Dear Seller,I have now ordered this same item 3 times & it is becoming very apparent that you’re lacking in quality control when sending product to customers.Order 1.) my package appeared to have been previously opened & tried on (not a big deal), but then I noticed that the zipper was broken & the stitching around the base was ripped.It otherwise looked cute & decent quality for the price.But it runs VERY small. Definitely needed to size up 1-2 sizes. For reference I am 5’3” in height, with 26” waist, 36” hips, 34” bust and typically wear size XS-S.The size small I ordered fit around me, but was way too short in the torso - which is surprising because I’ve never considered myself to be tall at just 5’3” & I have a short torso. I returned this item & reordered in a medium in hopes that it will arrive intact & will fit my torso properly & w/out the dreaded cameltoe lol.Order 2.) Size Medium fit much better. The length is perfect & despite the legs being baggy around my thighs, calves etc, it would work....then I noticed that it was dirty. Maybe the grey stains across the front would come out if washed, but I don’t want to try & wash it then be unable to return & be stuck with a dirty item if the stains didn’t come out. So I decided to order a third time.Order 3.) the zipper was not stitched correctly so it is mis-aligned at the top once fully zipped. It’s just annoying!!! Plus I’ve noticed that the seller had increased the price since my initial order. I’m not sure if I should just deal with the flawed costume or try a 3rd time.Please stop sending damaged/dirty/flawed items. This is ridiculous.

  This was a fantastic Halloween costume and addition to our dress up collection. The included accessories make it all the more fun. Beware, the helmet is a solid/heavy plastic and will fall off your kid’s head if they are running around with it on. I fixed this by glueing the inner head piece to the helmet (because it kept coming apart) and I also added a strap (wide red ribbon and Velcro) to go under the chin to keep the helmet on.

  I bought two of these for my 3 year old twin boys for Halloween, and then as dress-ups for thereafter.  My boys small for their age, and it's definitely big on them.  We had to roll up the sleeves on the jacket.  Otherwise, it's great!I am impressed that the helmet is a very firm plastic, unlike the cheap ones kids get from fire station tours.  It's adjustable too.  The bullhorn seems like its handle will crack apart pretty easily if dropped on a hard surface.  It accepts batteries that will supposedly cause it to make various fire-related noises.  We're waiting until Halloween night to put in the batteries though -- if we put them in at all.  The fire extinguisher's ""nozzle"" actually unscrews to reveal a hollow bottle, so kids can fill it with water if desired.UPDATE November 7, 2013:We put batteries in the bullhorns for Halloween.  They make one sound: a fire engine siren.  For some reason, I had expected several sounds.  The noise is not really as annoying as I anticipated.  It's not deafeningly loud.  The button to make the noise is in an awkward spot (even for adult hands) and our boys did not reach up to press it very often.  This saved us a headache, I suppose.I noticed one of my kids stepped on an extinguisher.  It flattened until I came and popped it back into shape - just like any plastic water bottle.The product description mentions that the child's name can be penciled on the name tag.  I used a Sharpie, which worked great.  The name tag is semi-gloss paperboard.

  I'm 5'4 and 20lbs 'overweight' with a 36D bust. I wear a size 10 dress (in moderately sized brands) I have naturally broad shoulders and ribcage but don't carry a lot of extra weight in my ribcage and I have a smaller waist than most people my size. I ordered a Med/Large and would have been happier with a medium.I have a long torso for my height and the skirt hit 6-8inches above my knee. (I'd probably be 5'8 if my legs weren't so darn short.)I don't blame the manufacturer for this, because I was on the fence about a med or med/large and I figured bigger was better than 'won't zip'. The very long red ribbon gives at least an extra six inches of torso room if loosened. I'm going to have to work with it to get it to look better than my pic does.The area I'm most self conscious of is from 3' below my belly button to the bottom of my hip. Other moms know what I'm talking about. This costume was perfect for covering that area. The part of the top that ends in a 'V' shape doesn't reveal anything I don't like there.This dress fully covers a bra, which was a relief, because it's hard to find a strapless that holds the girls up.The fabric is thin, as you'd expect from a costume. It definitely shows a bra in back. I don't 'bulge' there very much, but it seemed to accentuate what does.I usually can't wear a plastic headband without getting a headache, but the one included is actually very comfortable.The petticoat is not included, which is clear in the description. The secret wishes scarlet petticoat 'often bought with' this costume was shorter than I'd like. You won't be able to see it unless the dress is pulled up, the petticoat is pulled lower than it should be (like my pic) or you bend over, which looks sexy in the bedroom, but I wouldn't reccomend the modest do in public with the dress plus petticoat. (I'm not modest so this'll be fun with a cute pair of undies. 😉)The reason for only 3 stars is the collar. It doesn't just itch, it hurts!! I have soft skin and I'm going to have to find something to cover it where it attaches or my skin will likely rub raw. I couldn't just knock off one star, because it really really hurts. 😕

  The quality is typical of most costumes you'd find in the store.  The tunic is thin, but adequate.  I generally wear XL, but ordered the 2XL, and it is quite roomy.  I plan to ""stuff"" the tunic with pillows to give me that plump bee body.  I would have rated this higher, except that it did NOT come with leg warmers, as advertised.  I'm pretty bummed about that.

  I read a lot of reviews and I am glad i went with a Medium.  I am 6ft about 190lbs and it fits great.  the skirt part has elastic so its fine.  Without it, it would still be a little big.  the medallion is cloth and its garbage, throw it away.  Get either a nice plastic one or a cheap metal one like I did off Amazon.  The only complaint i have is that the cape is attached to the color and due to its weight it pulls the collar so it rides against my neck. But its not bad, just a little annoying.  I might look at a way to pin the collar to my shirt to stop this but then you cant remove the cape.  Overall its made well, looks great, and was priced right!

  If it was up to my son it would get 5 stars. I actually was going ro give 3 stars and see how happy he is each time he puts it on and extra star for my kids happiness. Costume is thin material my son can get in and out without any help. The mustache is the worst. Just one stick. (May not be one to share) the glue in the back doesn't hold well so it kept falling off. Now th glue tape has peeled off and mustache is worthless. Kind of defeats the whole Luigi thing. Son was so bummed about that. But he still puts it on and tries to do the best luigi impression.

  This costume doesnt really stay on. There is no way to tighten the straps and keep them tightened. The buckle allows them to be tightened at the top but then you go to pull the strap down and it can't be pulled down as it is sewed. Very odd design. The shirt is also very flimsy. But works as a costume for one day. Also never received the socks for the costume.

  This runs 2 sizer smaller. I'm usually a XS or a S but I have to order M and it is still somewhat small. The hat does not look like the picture and looks awkward in real life. It does not come with the stocking and the stick so you may need to buy those in addition to complete the look.Since the costume runs small so it is really tight and looks like the picture.

  Beautiful costume, but be careful with it! If you pull too hard near the zipper, you risk ripping a seam. The costume shipped quickly, but arrived VERY wrinkled. However, it ironed out nicely (lowest setting, higher heat made the fabric turn tacky, and you risk melting the garment). Just flip inside out when you iron, and be prepared for your ironing board to be covered in loose glitter. Got this for a princess party and am so excited to put the full costume together!

  Oh so close! I thought for sure I'd be giving 5 perfect  reviews. The shirt arrived today and where the Womens costume was perfect, the shirt was a little large on my guy. Worse than that was that it was only the shirt and not the full costume. It is listed as a costume. Perhaps I overlooked the details but considering it cost more than the full women's costume, we assumed....lesson learned.Luckily the party isn't until this Saturday and I can scurry to find pants.

  I am very happy with the quality of the jacket - that is the main reason we bought it for my son because who can be a doctor without the doctor's coat?  :)  The ID badge that you can personalize is a nice touch.  The surgeon's mask didn't fit him well but he didn't seem to really care for it anyway.  As many others have said, I didn't care for the stethescope's sounds.  It was a little freaky but mainly, it was sooooo annoying to hear!  All the tools, in my opinion, are just teal-colored plastic.  I didn't really like them when researching it online and I feel the same way with them in my hands.  Because of this we purchased the Fisher Price doctor's kit.  Kinda sucked to have to buy 2 items for basically one gift - and the M&D set was a tad pricey IMO for just the doctor's coat.It's a cute set, though.  I will warn any parents who knows their child will want to open this ASAP - there are red threads practically sewn into the coat to hold all the various instruments (for display purposes).  These were impossble to get off!  I had to use a knife/scissors combo and it was hard to do without cutting the jacket.

  Overall I loved the costume and I was super happy with how it all turned out. The skirt portion of the dress is a bit thin and therefore a little see through, but I was wearing white leggings anyway so not an issue (I assume also not an issue if you're wearing the red skirt with it, which I did not purchase). It did need a solid steam to get the wrinkles out upon arrival, but that was no problem. My only issue was the size. I referenced the size chart and I am certainly not a 0/2 dress size - so I went with the S\M and not the XS. I ended up needing to pin both sizes a fair amount but it wasn't noticeable and ending up being totally fine. For reference - I'm 5'3"" and 130lbs. I would happily purchase another costume from the same place, and just go down one size.

  I was super excited to get this, Luckily one of the seller was prime 2 days instead of prime 6-8 days which make no sense.The item came in a bag which was weird but whatever. Everything look new, I think. I put in fresh batteries and the blower would not turn on. Try 4 more fresh batteries and still nothing. Normally I would return things that wouldn't work but I needed this thing this weekend and next week for office party and at my business. I decided to took the battery unit apart and everything tested okay. The blower however the wire was disconnected from the motor terminal and would need to be solder back in. Luckily I had my Weller soldering iron and did a quick solder and while I was soldering one of the terminal I touch the other terminal and it immediately snap. WTH kind of quality was that.

  I bought this as a gift for my daughter’s 4th birthday. She loves it! She is pretty petite and I was worried it would be too big but it fits perfectly. All of the reviews I read said this is a company whose products are well made and it was. So much attention to detail! The only problem is it’s a little tough to get on/off. There isn’t a zipper so we struggle a bit to get it off which ripped a little bit of the mesh material along the collar. I still think it’s a great product for the money paid but I wish we didn’t have to be so careful.

  This is the Tyrannosaurus costume that I wore for Halloween. My 11 year old son was Deadpool and I chased him around our town. Hilarious stuff. We managed to get photographed and featured in the local newspaper. Anyway, I am 5 feet 8 inches tall 180 pounds and have a 42 inch chest. If the costume was any smaller, it wouldn't fit. I recommend that you allow this costume to off-gas for a while before putting it on. The fumes from the vinyl material can be brutal. Also, this thing does NOT breath very well so it's like wearing a sauna suit after a while and the view ports get fogged up. You can probably reduce the condensation by applying no-tears baby shampoo. Be forewarned: If you ever wondered what it's like to be a character at Disney, get this costume. Kids and parents alike will give you all the high fives you ever wanted (some kids might try to punch you in the balls).

But our twins loved them and still play with the hats all the time. Better than Walmart costumes.

  I have purchased almost all of the Melissa & Doug costumes. My three year old loves them all. This was fast shipping. Packaging was well. The costume fits my 36 pound sound perfectly. The accessories are plastic, but made well. No parts to harm your child. Has cute little name tag to write the Childs name on. Good gift idea for a child with a fun imagination. Would buy again from Amazon.

  Cute costume. Cheaply made, not mad though. But my fuzzy leg warmers weren’t with it. The package with the image when it arrived mentions only the antenna and wings and romper are in the costume set, but the Amazon description mentions leg warmers are included and that’s the whole real son I really bought the bee outfit in the first place.

  I'm petite 5'1"" 105 lbs so I ordered the smallest size which was Teen 7/9 and there is still plenty of room to tie back, the length goes all the way to mid-calf like the photo.  The sleeves are loose, they should be more fitted/snug so I don't know what I'm going to do about getting it to stay on! They should have elastic at the top to hold up in place.  Now the wig, oh boy, there isn't enough yarn strings covering the wig cap.  It is not entirely covered which leaves bald spots that is very noticeable in the back.  This costume needs huge improvement.  I might have to spend more money making proper adjustments just to look right and stay put.

  Purchased this for my 2 year old son who is obsessed with trains. He loves wearing it. It velcros on one side so it is easy to take off and put on. We were able to customize his name badge with his name and picture. The material is good quality- I haven't had to wash it yet however so I don't know how it will wash. The walkie talkie and tools and schedule have all been played with and fit in the pockets nicely. My son is in a size 3t and it is a little big on him but it doesn't bother him at all. He wears the hat everywhere, even to bed for naps. He's happy so I'm happy. We are definitely getting our money's worth with this item!

  As many other reviews have already noted, this runs VERY SMALL. I'm typically a US size 8 and I got an XL, which fit. If I were ordering again, I'd get an XXL because the XL is very snug when zipped up. I'm 5'1"" and the sleeves were a bit long but not unmanageable. There's a decent range of movement especially when unzipped, but the wing size makes it a difficult to reach your arms up. Pretty warm but I haven't tried washing it yet and it feels a bit like a very thick craft felt rather than clothing grade fabric and tbh I'm not convinced it would come out of a wash looking the same. Got lots of compliments and it was really comfy though. I'm very happy with the purchase overall despite the quality of the fabric.

  The top is nice. I truly expected higher quality from this product, but it was nothing better than what can be purchased at WalMart. The pants were uncomfortable, thin, see-through and too small. The vest is too big, but it is 1x/2x and I'm on the low end of 1x. If I could have see the product first, I would have never paid this price. The belt was unusable, as it was too large and the metal lining on the holes popped out when I tried to use the belt.

  The only minor complaint is that the zipper can be a little temperamental, and it actually broke within the first 10 minutes of wearing it. Luckily, my sister is a seamstress and knew how to fix it on the fly.The issue I found with it, is that it get SUPER hot inside, and the little viewing window fogs up really easily. Every time I opened the zipper and emerged, I was dripping with sweat and my hair was all kinds of static and wild.If you want to scare children and dogs, I recommend this. If you're in introvert and want to go do something wild and fun, I recommend this. If you just want to get a group of your friends together and terrorize the town, or go to a festival and put on a costume and a tutu (like I did) and do silly things while lots and LOTS of people come up and ask for a picture, I fully recommend this!

Also don’t let’s the sexy pictures fool you. The bigger the size the more fabric they add. The cut out part In the front is almost none existent and the sexy slits in the front are hidden by so much fabric you would have to pin it all back to even see any leg.

  I give this costume a fair rating. The front looks good, but it would have been great if the back matched it. The back was just pink and plain. I wore a long red wig that reached all the way to my hips, so the back of the dress was mostly covered up. I recommend buying another red wig since the one that came with the dress is a patchy, yarn wig. After that small modification, the Sally dress was a hit!

  This must be a Childs size! But I double checked the tag inside the costume and it even says adult standard size. I’m 5’7” and could not see out of the face viewer at all! It was way too low. After about 30 minutes (if that) I had to get out of the costume. Not only was the face completely fogged over but I wasn’t able to see my kids as they trick or treated. And after my six year old ran out into the street to cross it without looking, I decided Enough was enough. My friend that was with me stopped my kid but it could’ve been much worse. I was really disappointed this didn’t workout for me. This would’ve been a lot of fun but there is no way this is an adult size. I met up with other trex’s last night and seeing theirs compared to mine I realized that this isn’t my adult size that I needed. The quality seems pretty good of the sewing and zipper. The fan isn’t that powerful, yes I used fresh new batteries. But it doesn’t have enough power, remember I said the face viewer was fogged over. The painted/printed design on the material also had a lot of smudges. In several places. I just took pictures of a few. Would I buy this again? No, not for myself. For a child? No. The price you pay for what you get isn’t worth it. The fan is weak, the design is smudged and the roar device is way too quiet. I’d look for a higher quality item that might cost $10 more. It might be worth it!

  I'm 5'11"" and 185 lbs and this was oddly fitted to say the least. Based on reviews from others I thought that the Med/Large would be really small on me, and it probably would be, but the XL is huge :/ I was able to tuck the extra length in the legs into my boots, so that was fine, but the body was for someone at least 50lbs heavier than me and with longer arms. High quality product though, so if you can find a size that fits I'm sure you'll be happy and I did get a lot of compliments on it.

  First thing I need to address is the only reason I gave this two stars is that it's actually really nice looking. But that's pretty much all it's got going for it. The main piece tha you put over your head and has the robe on it fits, but everything else is extremely small and does not stretch or fit! Now I got an XL to really make sure it fits even though according to the sizing I'm a large, and it's still way too freaking small! Boot covers, belt, and gloves did not fit at all.

  I have to disagree with the reviews saying it isn't true to size and to size up. I usually wear a medium, sometimes a small depending on the brand. I ordered this in a M and it fits perfectly fine on me. I was worried the sleeves would be too big for me as I'm really short but they worked great. For reference I usually wear a size 6/8 or S/M and I'm 5ft. I loved this outfit, my preschoolers were studying bats and I knew it was the perfect Halloween costume. The kids loved it and I was super warm and cozy all day. I will say that this wouldn't be super comfy if you live in a climate that is very warm in October.

  I'm a size 10 in jeans, 5'5 1/2, 175lbs with 36D, bought a large, it looked great, it was cold for Halloween so I wore long sleeve and leggings underneath, it still looked great. If it wasn't cold I was only going to wear leggings and a Cali because it was a little too low cut to go trick or treating with the kids. By all means it is just spanx, no one really looks that good in spanx unless you're a Power Ranger. The red fabric around the waist was a nice accent even though, again it's Spanx. The one thing that bothered me was the red fabric that's suppose to ties at the thighs kept falling. The price is pretty decent for a costume like this. Granted most Halloween costumes aren't meant to last and made pretty cheaply. The fabric wasn't thick, nor was it THAT thin but I wore leggings just in case.

  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to order this costume a size down from my normal size per recommendations of others. Turns out you may need to order 2 sizes down. I ended up returning the first costume and getting an even smaller size which fit perfect. I wore a red cami underneath it for a more modest look. The length was great and landed right above my knees. Perfect for a more conservative costume, but still with a little sex appeal!

  This costume looks like the pic. It can be adjusted with ties on the back and fits true to size. The colors are somewhat dull and the wig does not look at all like the photo, it is just long yarn attached on the top, leaving some visible gaps that don't look so nice. It is worth it to invest in red yarn and fill it up a bit. Yet for the price it's a nice buy. The sleeves are loose so plan on putting some elastic or something to stop them from riding down your arm. The neck graphics on our costume were off so that kinda sucks because we'll have to camouflage with paint and try to make it all look nice. Like I said, not bad for the price but not wow either.

  The quality is not great, but is in line with most modern Halloween outfits. THe mustache is single use - has one cut to size double sided adhesive that you stick on.

  We bought this for our nephew. He is a fan of fireman Sam. This was a very high quality set for the price. He absolutely loved this! He wore it all around on Christmas Eve so proud of his very own fireman suit! I would buy this again for sure. He even had his own little name badge. This was definitely a memorable purchase for such a special little guy.

  I'm a size 10 and based on previous ratings I decided to star up and ordered a large. Even though their size chart says that large fits a size 12-14 it is quite snug on me. I have to wear the skirt around my waist as it won't close around my hips. The quality of the costume otherwise Is good.

  Do you have a need to scare police dogs? A need to look like a giant toddler T-Rex? Or maybe you just like to hide in the pillowy sheath that is the TREX? Then this is the costume for YOU. It's relatively quiet if your not the person inside the TREX and the batteries last for a surprisingly long time. Just be careful when you try to run away from said police dog, the crotch rides really low and you're more likely to ""waddle"" than run.

  I got a medium and I'm 5'2'' at 112 lbs. It was perfect length, not too short, or too long. It's really cute and cozy. I didn't even need a jacket for Halloween since it kept me warm. I was even sweating. The only thing I hated about the costume was the placement of the dorsal fin. It was supposed to be at the upper back as it was shown in the picture but it sticks out awkwardly directly from my butt. Not cool at all.

  This costume is great for the price - I personally have no issue with the back being a solid color, it doesn't take anything away from the costume.  The tie makes it adjustable.  I'm 5'5"" and 145 pounds and the large fits me, while I typically wear a medium.  The wig can be easily pinned to your hair and while the back doesn't offer really full coverage, it does the job and I liked it. I was happy to find a Sally costume that wasn't slutty that I could wear to work - this is the most authentic version you'll find.

  I bought this for 4year old daughter as her Halloween costume. I have read somebody's review about the mask been very big;however, they have made some improvements to the strings on the mask which now adjustable with elastics.I was very impressed with their quality of all the accessories(simple and easy).  My daughter loves doing role-playing with me, her little sister and her babies. It seems like what really helped her was having the doctor jacket. The rest she can use anything to manipulate Dr's.  I'm not sure about educational value, but kids can learn so much from playing especially role-playing.

  I love this T Rex costume. I wear it a lot. I’m 6 feet tall and it fits well, someone taller then me might could fit in it but not sure on that. I have bought 2 of these. The first one wore out after about 2 years of wearing it all over the United States. One time I did have to get out of it fast because I was in high elivation and started having trouble breathing. But I have also been able to run in it for about half a mile or so before I stopped because of condensation. The one thing to use caution of with this though is to be careful when getting out. If you aren’t careful you can rip the material by the zipper. I did this and just sewed it back. You just have to make sure to lean over to avoid this. Overall, I would buy this again (I actually did). The price seemed to fluctuate on here so watch it for a little while before buying to get the best price. It’s best to not buy it around Halloween because the price seems to be highest then.

  Third time trying to write this....my laptop keeps jumping me out of the review.  Anyway, this is a super cute costume that fit fairly well except in the upper arms, where it felt a bit tight.  There is some stretch to the middle and the velveteen is very stiff, not uncomfortable but stiff.  I paired the outfit with some black/white vertical striped leggings, black ankle boots with lace-topped ankle socks, a black net crinoline slip and a super curly tri-color brown wig NOT a clown wig. I wanted something bouncy and fun.  The top hat is super cute too and fit over the wig just fine without feeling like it was going to pop off so unless you have a head bigger than a bowling ball, it should fit and stay on just fine.  I expect to get many many compliments with this one!!!  For reference,  I am 5' 3"" and usually wear a 2X ~ I bought this costume in the 3X-4X size which  fit around my big belly and with the velcro adjustable belt made me look more shapely., a nice extra bonus.  I LOVE this costume and recommend it to everyone!  Can't wait for Halloween!

  I bought this for my 6 year old son for Christmas.  He asked for a doctor's kit, and specifically said he wanted the surgical mask and jacket as well.  This set seemed perfect until I received it.  The surgical mask is too small, and the sleeves on the jacket are at least an inch too short.  He can BARELY fit the jacket over a tee-shirt, and if a child wasn't stick thin like my son, he'd never get it on.  The fabric is cheap and the collar doesn't lay flat. The doctor tools aren't realistic at all (very cheap plastic), and the stethoscope was missing it's battery cover.  My son was very disappointed in this set as was I.  Don't waste your money.

The costumes are well made, easy to get in and out of and include a badge that can be personalized for the child. We have taken his picture and put his name on the badge that stays in a clear plastic badge holder on the front of the costume. My grandson had friends over and each of them put on the costumes. This was a great gift and I am very happy. The items that come with each costume make the cost very reasonable. There are at least 4 accessories with each costume.

The one closest to the body is cotton, for warmth, which is great for the East coast. My daughter is 3years old, we are still between 4T/5T, I got the 4T.

  My kids wanted the whole family to dress as bats this year and I originally selected these Leg Avenue costumes because they have this costume in both kid sizes and adult sizes all the way up to 4X to accommodate my husband.  These costumes are terrific. As other reviewers mention, they are basically a hoodie so this may have been the easiest Halloween ever!  They are long enough to cover the bum so my daughter and I wore leggings and my son and husband wore black sweatpants.  The hoodies are really well made so my kids are just wearing them as super cute hoodies now. Win!

  I shopped around (at Halloween costume stores and online) and this is by far the best deal for the price. You get a hat, shirt, long socks, and a one-piece shorts/suspenders). Quality is right where it should be. A Large fit me fine at 5'8"" 175 lbs (although I do prefer clothes slightly loose, Medium would've probably been a little tight, but that's my personal taste). The straps are adjustable for those graced with more height than me. You'll probably have to safety pin them in place (no biggie as they slide around, but women have been dealing with that for centuries). And the pant waist expands (luckily because I'm a 36"" maybe 37"" as I've started to put on my ""winter coat"" for the the colder season in the north east). Hat came a little smushed, but I put some paper inside it to pop it back out for when I'm ready. I have a pretty large head and it fits fine. ***For all those haters out there who give poor reviews and are expecting an actual Oktoberfest high-quality premium outfit (not a costume), go spend the $100-120 for the real deal and go cosplay. For those whose who like to have fun and will get some laughs at parties, not to mention multiple years out of a pretty well made product, this is for you. Happy Oktoberfest-ing!

  My 5-year-old has long legs but the size 6 dress was out of stock so I ordered the size 5. It was barely short like not even noticeable. I bought her this dress with accessories and took her to a princess ball for her birthday. The material and quality were so much better than expected. It was just gorgeous and she had one of the prettiest dresses there. After the ball, she has been playing in it almost daily and it has held up better than expensive dresses we have bought. I ordered her a mermaid costume for these same sellers for Christmas and it looks so beautiful as well (I had to open it and look before I wrapped it). I will only be ordering her dresses from this company.

Reviews said it runs small - I'm 5' 7"" and weigh about 130 lbs - - I would typically get a medium for outer wear - so got a large and it's tight when zipped, but comfortable.  The sleeves just about make it to my wrists and I have long arms so I'm used to arms being short - it's cute and comfortable.

The hat has a piece that always comes off, the solution for it is a little bit of crazy glue in the little holes. And about the adjustable strap, I had to tape it with yellow tape, otherwise it wont stay closed. A little flaws but great product, very cute.

  We really like this Melissa & Doug costume. It’s well made and extremely cute. My son loved using this as his Halloween costume and both of my sons have continued using the set for their every day play.I docked one star for two reasons.1. The goggles are tiny! My 5 year old son fit perfectly in the entire outfit except the goggles barely even fit my 3 year old. They were too small to wear over his eyes.2. The hat has an inner plastic piece that’s supposed to be adjustable to size it to your child’s head size. This thing was impossible to keep connected, basically making it useless. We ended up taking it out all together and the boys just wear the hat without it, even though that means the hat is a little big for now.Overall, we are happy with this purchase and it’s something we use every day. I would recommend this to others.

  Really wanted to be a shark, so went with this because I'm too lazy to do a DIY costume. The model, of course, is completely false advertising because it's definitely not what it looks like on the average customer. Fit was a bit poor - I sized up and got a medium and still felt like I was bulging out of it all day and could barely zip it up over my chest (full 34C/32D). Not bad, but I'd probably say go with a different costume or shark idea.

  I do not recommend this product. The zipper jammed the first time I tried to put it on. When I got it unstuck, it separated below the slide and I could not reconnect it. Also, the fan seems under-powered for keeping the costume firmly inflated, but I could not confirm that because the costume never closed correctly to begin with. Beware of a very low price, the quality is commensurate to that.  I returned this item the day after it arrived.

  this was purchased for my grandaughter who was turning 2.  I know this sounds a bit young but our entire family is in the medical field so it was very appropriate.  When she opened it, all she could say was Hurry Hurry Hurry, we could not get the security threads off the items fast enough.  this was the first birthday present she opened and she could care less about the rest of the gifts.  She went to bed with the jacket on, she did take it off long enough to put on jammies but then had to put it back on.  Everyone in the family got a physical along with the dog and I'm certain we will be getting many more.  I cannot say enough good things about this lab coat and toys.  It was the hit of the party.

The wig was sewn so oddly, I couldn't figure out how to wear it. All the hair is towards the front, like it would have made a better inverted mullet.

  Amazing price for such a good quality product! I ordered this, along with 2 others in the collection, on a Saturday morning and received it on Monday afternoon. Also, I paid only $5 shipping and handling for the entire order! What a deal. I was very impressed with the quality of the outfits and the amount of extras that were included. Out of the three outfits there was only one defect (missing earpiece on stethoscope). The outfits all have pockets, velcro closures, headpieces, name tags, and at least 3 accessories that make play dress up so much fun for my 4 1/2 year old. The size of the outfits are appropriate as well. They make great Halloween costumes, too, and are so much less expensive.

  We have quite a few Melissa and Doug costumes/outfits and they are all great.  This one is a race suit (with a velcro cinch waist strap), a foam steering wheel and a helmet with a plastic visor.  Both our son and daughter wear and like this, and it fits both of them (3 and a 5 year old).The only downside is the piece that keeps the helmet tight on your head,likes to come out.  Some glue keeps this in, but somewhat annoying.  Otherwise the race suit is very well constructed, the foam wheel is quite durable (although over time they will bend and discolor, but they are very resilient -- we have quite a few of these foam accessories).

  I bought the medium size and I am 6'1"" 185 lbs and it fits a little snug according to the sizing chart. The color is great and there is a spider graphic on the back. I may have been better off with the large, but it will work out.  I am breaking it in as it does need to stretch a little bit.  The zipper is not the strongest and the teeth do not lock together too well so you have to make sure you get it zipped all the way down the back of your head so the zipper does not separate. (My head might be a little large too) It is tough to get the costume zipped all the way up, but I used a wire hanger to hook the bottom zipper, grabbed the back of the costume to keep the zipper edges close together and pulled up.  Worked like a charm.  It is ok to see through, but I figured the vision would be a little blurry.  It gets tight around the ankles, again this should correct itself with a little wear.  The material is thin, but the seams are well constructed and tough.  I wouldn't yank on it too hard though.  No problems so far, then again, i have only had it for a day.  If there are any other issues, I will post to this review again.  If there are none, i will update this review after Halloween 2014.

  What a delightful dress-up outfit for the construction-minded kids in your life. The outfit is durable, well-made and has enough accessories to make a little one feel and look like a real construction worker. This was a must for my grandsons after watching the video series ""The Detonators"" and all of their other construction videos. They even got to wear them when they met Jim Redyke of Dykon Explosive Demolition and he was kind enough to autograph their hardhats. Even if you're not lucky enough to go to a demolition, if your little ones like to play construction worker, buy this outfit for them! It will last and last and afford a great deal of fun!

  Noticed the eyes didn't light up.  Looks like someone crossed the wires in assembly.  The usb cord goes into the fan unit and there are two wires coming from there that get hooked into the wires coming to the light up eyes with crimp ""butt"" connecters.  I saw voltage on the connectors so pulled the wires out and reversed, like magic the eyes worked..  Would have gotten a 5 star if I didn't have to rewire it.  Space left in the connectors so I was able to shove the wires in and compress those so I didn't have to use new ones.  Hilarious costume, everything else was on point.

  I have just tried it on inside so far but seems great. When zipped up before turning on the pump, it seems like it might be claustrophobic but it isn’t at all when you use the pump.  FYI the pump is just this little lightweight square with a plastic belt clip connected to it, so it’s pretty easy to clip onto something you’re wearing.  Once you zip up and then turn on the pump, it takes maybe 1-2 minutes if that (maybe less than a minute) to fill up.  I’m 5’9” and I can put my head at either of the two areas with the clear plastic in order to look out (both around the dinosaur’s neck area). The head and mouth of the dinosaur are above my head completely so it’s nice and airy in there when the pump is going, and it’s even cool inside the dinosaur with the air going. Disclaimer - I haven’t run around in it so I don’t know if that will hold up. The dinosaur arms are pretty short but I think that’s the nature of the t-Rex - it seems like it’d be risky to try to pull your hands/arms up over your shoulders because I just don’t think there’s enough fabric there to allow that without possibly ripping the costume. The dinosaur legs came basically all the way down to my feet. There are holes in the feet, so the costume cinches around your ankles like cinched sweatpants would, and then the dinosaur feet basically overlay your shoes (the dinosaur feet are big enough that they completely cover your shoes so you really wouldn’t see what shoes someone had on). Your shoes then are completely outside of the costume, but everything else is in the costume except your hands and maybe a little part of your wrists/arms, but the costume comes with gloves for your hands. It’s a hilarious and awesome looking costume. I think someone 6’ or so would still probably be able to see through the top of the 2 areas with the clear plastic. Anything higher, you might still be able to fit in the open, airy head part of the dinosaur, but you’d have to scrunch to be able to look out of the plastic I think.

We have several of the “Made in China” all spandex, superhero body suit costumes, and this one has little to no real stretch.

  The radio didn't work.  Even if the radio had worked, I didn't think this product was worth the price charged.  You get two cheap plastic tools and a plastic schedule.  I augmented the outfit with a paper punch and spiral tablet as play tickets that could be punched.  I added a little flashlight and a whistle on a lanyard, and put in some real Amtrak schedules.  Without my additions this would not have been much fun, especially with the broken radio.  Melissa and Doug's products have been declining in quality in the past year or so, in my opinion.

  The jacket was so pretty, the dress was a bit tight and small, however the worst part was that as soon as I opened the package containing the costume I got this horrible musty smell wafted at my face. I don't know if the costume had somehow gotten wet and was sitting in the package getting that musty smell or if it was animal urine, but man did it smell bad. I opened it on Halloween to wear and immediately put it back in the bag and decided not to wear it because the smell was so bad.

  Based on others' reviews, I ordered a size up (I normally wear medium, but ordered a large), and that may have been a mistake. The length was good in a large, but I still wore leggings underneath just in case. The hood was rather loose / floppy, so the fake fur trim kept getting in the way of my eyes. I might've preferred to have a medium for this reason. If you're already planning on wearing leggings or something underneath it, you may want to just order your regular size. It's a cute costume and I will definitely reuse it. It's also very warm, which is great if you're wearing it outdoors. It may be *too* warm if you're at a crowded indoor party. One other thing to note - the bat wing sleeves felt slightly awkward while driving. I was afraid the seams might rip when I extended my arms to hold the wheel, but that did not happen. It might have felt more awkard if I had ordered my regular size.

  Cool looking costume. Difficult to put on for my 5 year old. The feet are closed so his shoes stay inside the costume (makes it a little slippery). The hands have built-In gloves. The back zippers. He is not able to get it on or off by himself, so we can’t use it for his school party. It will be great for around the house or if we were trick or treating. The feet would get dirty though. My son loves the costume and it does look good on.

  I got this for my son's fourth birthday as he loves firefighters. He put it on immediately. I chose this one over others on here because of the material that the jacket is made of. It is made of a canvas type material so it feels nice and strong, and there stripes are real reflectors so it would make a great Halloween costume.My son has been where this jacket almost non stop since his birthday but I made him take it off for church. He also loves the toys that it comes with and he really likes carrying them around in the loops. The bullhorn makes a siren sound which is a little annoying, but he uses that and pretends he has to run to the fire and put it out.His six year old brother even likes it and he doesn't normally like dress up; I think I need to buy the police officer one now so they each have one. Both the costume and hat fit both boys. The only thing I do not like, is the hat, the adjustable strap on the inside keeps popping out so I keep having to fix it, and my son has a little trouble getting his tools back on the loops, but this was definitely a big hit, and I am so glad I got it.

  This costume fit just as i expected. It is good quality. It is a 4 piece costume just as the description states. I like that it brings pretty much everything you need for the costume. All i needed to add to it were a pair of boots and fishnet stockings to complete the look. I got alot of compliments on halloween night and not to mention, my boyfriend loved the costume! I would recommend to wear a pair of boyshorts underneath though, as the dress is quite short and when you dance it slowly starts moving upwards, I am glad i was wearing boyshorts, otherwise everything would have been up in the air!

  Can't wait to wear this costume on Halloween!I am 5'10, 155 lbs, 36D and I ordered a small (i usually wear a medium/large). I am so happy I ordered a size down!The mesh body suit fits me perfectly with no wrinkles and the dress is a bit stretchy so it zips up with no trouble and fits just snugly enough that I don't have to wear a bra! WOO! I will say that the dress part is better suited for taller people as it just touches the floor at my height, with no heels on. Nice materials too, I am very happy with the quality of the sequins and jewels at the top of the dress.Bummer that there's no opening in the mesh suit for potty breaks, but for how good the costume looks I am willing to endure the trouble it's going to take to go to the bathroom!

  I got this costume yesterday and tried it on. It was better than I thought :) It has a zipper up the left side of the skirt (I guess to help getting it on?). The buckles in the front are great and the shoulder straps Velcro in the front so, like others have said, it can be crossed in the back or straight. One of the straps even has a place where you can put 3 bullets if you have them.The arm and leg bands also Velcro closed, but they are VERY tight, and I am a relatively athletic person so I thought that this is odd. I might make my own by cutting up some black tights.The gloves are a little big, they fit my boyfriend better than they fit me.Overall I think it'll be a hit! I am pairing it with this belt (

  The fit was a bit on the larger size and the openings on the bottom of the costume are very high.  The openings will definitely reveal all your goodies if you are not careful.  Also, the length is very long and a tripping hazard.

  Pros:It is ADORABLEIt’s toastyIt’s not poorly madeCons:I generally wear a large, but ordered an xl because I have a pretty large chest and Halloween costumes are always trying to make you spill out. This was still a bit too small, making the zipper rippleObviously, I knew that arm movement would be limited in this thing, but I seriously underestimated how many people would be hugging me on Halloween. If you’re a hugger, this is a mistake.

  Super duper bummed. The costume is HILARIOUS - but my kiddo was crushed because the LED eyes don’t light up. If we hold the wires just right we can get them to flicker. Otherwise, the fan works and it inflated and is so great. But those eyes!! Ugh.

  The costume overall is really cheap in quality. The waist band has a strange fit where the lower portion fits and the top is too big by probably 2 inches and just hangs around. The neck tie Velcro’s to the cape in a very strange design choice. Over all it gets the point across but I wouldn’t but it again especially not at the price I did.

  Plastic zipper so cheap it wouldn't even go up once before it broke.  Not only the zipper itself but the zipper pull literally broke into two pieces.  No way I can even fix it.  This specifically says its a mens costume.  Its one piece from toe to finger to attached hood/ mask.  My son is 5'4"" and it was tight from bottom to top.  He's 120 lbs with a 28"" waist (skinny as a rail) and was skin tight but I suppose that's that it should be.  But height wise I wouldn't put someone more than 5'2"" in it.  Left absolutely nothing to the imagination in terms of what was under it.  This was a size medium which was supposed to be a 42"" chest.  Absolutely would not fit a man with more than a 34"" chest.  My son has a normal size head and this was tight.  Not even sure it would have zipped around his head.  As zipper was broken we never got that far.But we were willing to put up with it being tight in every way.  The zipper makes it unusable.  For the price I'm stunned.  The fabric quality was OK.  About what you expect in a retail store Halloween costume, its not meant to be used more than a few times.  Design was good.  One piece with appropriate coloring in right places.  Feet, gloves and hood/ mask all attached which is  a plus or minus depending on your preference.  Size wise a foolish design because not everyone is the same height.Returning to Amazon.  Never returned a thing to Amazon before.  This clearly not Amazon fault.  Arrived in perfect condition, unopened.

  If you are ordering this from the link that advertises ""Officially licensed Jurassic world t-rex costume fits a 42 to 44-inch jacket size with up 34 to 36-inch waist "", you will not receive that size. The package itself also listed up to a 44"" jacket size, but once opened, it was clearly not an adult size costume. My wife is 5'4"" (please, don't tell her I referred to her size as, ""clearly not adult""). She was able to get into the costume, but it was a bit tight height wise. I am 6', but meet the advertised chest and waist size advertised. Before buying, I had spotted a review from a fellow 6' buyer, who quoted the item was snug in the height, but worked. I think he may have purchased his from a different link selling the same item, or there is a very loose size variable in packaging. I somewhat suspected the product would be a bit short, but upon opening the package, I didn't even try to put it on. It would have been silly to try. I had hoped that ""Officially licensed"" would also mean accurately listed. Still, the shipment was fast, the material is as advertised, and the item is returnable. If I can find one that is accurately listed in my size, I still plan on purchasing one of these outfits.

  I'm in love with it! It fits perfectly. I'm 5 4'' 125lb and ordered a small (I am a regular small. I've read the reviews about getting one size bigger, but I just orderd my regular size). The colors are really great. The sewing on the collar wasn't the best but it really doesn't matter once you see it all together. Everybody loved my costume! It came with a few weird yellow stains but I was able to easily remove it with a Tide-to-go. The hat is kinda too big and since is made of foam, it is kinda too light to stay in your head the whole time, especially with wind. A wire would really help to make it stay in the place. Gave 4 stars just because of the stains and the hat.

  SIZE MEDIUM  says fits up to size 5'4  My son is always a medium so I ordered this before seeing the 5'4 limit.  My son is 5'9 and 150 pounds and it fit pretty well except in the ankles it was really tight. He wears a size 10 shoe so the material is stretched at the ankle. However, other peoples reviews had 5'9 and 160 pounds fitting really well, and with some wear it stretches and gives a bit so we are hoping it will do just that.This is an amazing costume. It looks great on. Hope this helps.

  I wanted a nice easy, comfortable costume that I can just throw on. This is good for that if you plan on being outside all Halloween night in Maine. Otherwise, this is just way too warm. I live in NJ, where it can be anywhere between 45 and 65 on Halloween, and I think I would still be sweating in this even if it was on the colder side. There’s no way I would be comfortable wearing this inside at all. This is a no-go for me. For size reference, I usually wear 14-16, and the 1x-2x fit well. It’s fitted, but not tight.

  My two year old is obsessed with all things Fireman, and once again, Melissa and Doug does not disappoint.  With a well-constructed fireman jacket, hat, and accessories, my little man can't get enough.  Only criticism is the hat: entirely too large to fit the rest of the outfit.  The hat is for a larger child, while the coat is definitely geared up to age 5 or 6.  As with all of M&Ds products, it is well made, sturdy, and provides hours of dress-up entertainment!

  I had reservations about this, but am ultimately very happy with the purchase. As others have said, the outfit is more of a hoodie than a dress. I am pretty short at only 5'2""  so I could have worn it as a dress, but I still chose to wear it with shorts. It is very warm and thick, and the hood rests just right. The bosom is a little tight and while the fuzzy hood accent is a nice touch, it makes it look more like a cat than a bat. I had to order a size up, and the bosom was still a little snug, but other than that, I love it, and plan to wear it as a hoodie for the entire month of October every year to come!

  The dress arrived today torn and too large for me. The material is cheap and the dress will make you look wider than you are. Without a petty coat it’s not cute. I would go with another dress that doesn’t have the tie up lace in the front because it makes it look cheap. Overall not satisfied.

  I absolutely loved wearing this costume.  It's hilarious and makes everyone laugh.  I'm a plus sized short girl, and it fit me fine.  It's a little hard to put on and get the fan running on your own, so it's better to have someone to help you with it.  I wore it for about two hours and the batteries stayed strong.  I plan on wearing this many times, as it seems very well made to do so.  I don't see it being very warm on a cold Halloween, however.  I had a fleece lined shirt and fleece lined leggings on, and was decently warm on a 58 degree fall day.

  Although the costume looks decent, in terms of details, etc., the color looks pretty off, in terms of the photo at Amazon. In the photo, it looks like a more olive drab, but in actuality, it's a more bright, almost kelly green. That color mismatch ensured that it wasn't what my son was looking for (hard to look like a cool, stealthy ranger-type, when you're the color of the Lucky Charms leprechaun).

  My train-loving toddler loves this thing, but I only gave it 3 stars for a few reasons, first, the first set we received was broken/torn, luckily amazon accepted it back right away and we were able to get a refund and order a new one. Second, the hat seems pretty small. I have a 3 year old and he won't wear the hat because it is too tight, and he has an average sized head. Next, the walkie-talkie is SUPER LOUD and has no volume control, and the walkie-talkie plays train sounds, which doesn't make much sense to me. Finally, there are no directions as to what type of pens will work best on the tickets so we don't actually write on those when we play.I do like that it is washable (or so it says, I haven't washed it yet) and my child loves it, so that's what matters.

  Max's wife here:I didn't buy this costume, but I did try it on at a local costume store the other day. It is a very cute costume and I liked the overall fit of it. I am a size 8, usually a medium in clothing/dresses. I tried on the M/L and it had a lot of room. I had to pull the sleeves up because it was big in the arms and the chest/stomach area was a little baggy. The only thing I didn't like was there wasn't much detail. The costume itself is cute, but would need makeup or a tutu/stockings to pull it all together. The dress is actually very thick in fabric, it is a velvet-type dress and is very comfortable. The collar accessory is big, and sat at the base of my neck (I have a very skinny neck in general, so it could've been just me). The hat is very very stiff, but I'm sure it would loosen up once you wear it or handle it. If you have the right supplementary accessories, it would complete the costume. I would add a skirt under and maybe some striped tights if I do decide to buy this costume! It's also long as far as costumes go. I am 6"", and it hit mid-thigh.

  I got an XL which lists size 42 waist as it's upper range. I wear 44 normally and have no problem fitting into this. I would think a 46 might fit into them as well, but I can't guarantee it. I'm 6'5"" and about 290 lbs and overall the fit is good. The shirt is short for my height but stays tucked into the lederhosen decently. Like everyone else says, the suspenders are way too long even at my height. Just did a quick fix with safety pins to tighten it up.The quality is better than I expected for the price. It's obvious that it's a costume, but probably one of the best made costumes I've bought over the years.

The back is pink, but it didn't matter much because since it is a bit big for her, we are just pulling the tie across the back tighter. And yes the wig could be a bit better-more populated with yarn.

  I was extremely relieved when this costume arrived as I did not have time to purchase and return before our Halloween party.  It was beautiful, just like pictured.  I didn’t purchase the gloves because I thought they may get in the way while eating, and was happy with that decision.  I added some jewels that I bought at Michaels to the necklace to give it some extra bling.  I typically wear a size 6, but purchased a size larger in fear it may run small.  I would have been fine with the smaller size but it worked just fine.  I am a 36 D and the top was slightly larger than I hoped.  My husband wore the California Costumes Men’s Storybook Prince costume and we got tons of compliments.  I would dare say this was my favorite costume to date!

  I knew my three year old son would love this set because he loves tools and I have seen him playing with the jacket and hardhat at this one play zone we go to regularly.  My only complaint with the set would be the goggles.  The strap isn't adjustable and it's a bit too  big for my son's head.  Actually, the goggles are even too big for his five year old sister as well.All in all though, this is a good set.

  I was pleasantly surprised by the fit of this costume. It's pretty comfortable, it's figure flattering and I like that it came with a head piece and the sleeves have gold cuffs so you really don't need to add any kind of bracelet jewlery. My only complaint is that the jeweled neck part doesn't lay flat, it kind of bubbles up in the center but it's not really a big deal. The dress is super long but that's an easy fix imo.

  I bought it because it looked cute, lots of reviews said it was comfortable, and I was tired of doing costumes I wasn't entirely comfortable in. 3 things I learned from purchasing this.1) I bought a size up because I wanted to be super cozy and comfortable. Even doing that, it was a bit tight and I was really disappointed when I first put it on. I was still able to zip it up, even if I felt like a sausage, so I ended up wearing it anyway. I wore some cute makeup to go with it and it made for a cute costume.2) The hooves are not the same fabric as the rest of the costume. They're like a stiff felt? or something? I wore this costume to work and the hooves over my hands made typing an awkward experience, lol. On the plus side, I kept want to hold my hands up and imitate hoof movements.3) This sheds. A lot. I had brown pieces of fabric all over my desk, chair, and floor. I have no idea how this will do after it's washed.

  If you have a child that is obsessed with Bendy march than we have the same struggle! Of course my 8-year-old wanted to be Bendy for Halloween and upon shopping I found this one.  I LOVED the price and much of the Bendy stuff is over priced in my opinion but this costume was not, under $30 at the time of purchase and it is very cute on him : ) We have made sure not to give it to him before Halloween as the plastic mask is quite thin and easily broken but am happy with this purchase. I knew the material would  be pretty thin but we just layer up the kid and he is excited.  Great costume.

  My 3.5yo wore the costume for 2016 Halloween.  He's very happy with the costume.  The only thing I'm NOT crazy about is props.  The fire extinguisher is useless.  Not sure what is intended for... a water bottle or sprayer. It has a little hole at the nozzle that water can come out of it.If it is intended to be a water bottle, it leaks around rim of the bottle.  I think the props for the costume can be improved. The loud speaker really doesn't do anything. But my 3.5 yo son is happy...so I give it four stars.

  Not what is pictured. At all. Not even close. I’ll add a picture because I’m just baffled.I bought a large because my measurements matched the size chart. Nope. Too small.Ordered this in an XL and while it fits and it looks like a bat costume it is not a dress. It is more of a jumper rather than a dress. Now, I totally would’ve just kept it but when I lift my arms for bat position it give the ultimate wedgie. If I had known I was not getting a dress but was getting a jumper I would’ve sized up again or just found something other than a dang bat to be.Now here’s the best part.

  This costume was definitely a hit! It's just the right amount of sexy! I added a corset and loved the way it looked. You definitely cannot wear a regular bra with this. I wore the rabbit lift bra and it worked great. Double sided fashion tape will be your best friend! I used it to keep the top in place and on the red strings that go around your legs. I had to give it 4 stars because  it's extremely tedious to use the bathroom when wearing this outfit because it's a body suit. Imagine wearing this with a corset, having to reappy fashion tape, etc. All while you're trying to have a good time drinking. Other than that it looks great!

  This costume was a lot of fun to wear and was actually very comfortable since it had plenty of stretch to it.  I'm 165 and 5' 2"", 40C chest and a size Large fit me fine, though I did not wear a bra since the dress beneath was a bit snug on top.  The jacket fit as expected.  A couple a tweaks that I had to make, which were no big deal...  I turned the belt around so the velcro wouldn't pop open when I moved, and just moved the buckle over the velcro portion.  I safety pinned the jacket closed beneath the belt since it's only held closed by a tiny piece of velcro.  The hat pops up right after opening the package and looks great.  One thing, after about an hour the opening of the hat begins to stretch and fell badly over my face.  I'd recommend putting some kind of a little band in there to stop it from falling.  This costume is darling and has so much to it for the price.  I added the harlequiin Leg Avenue tights and my own boots. Purple lipstick is fun with this!!

  This costume fit my (almost) 2 year old perfectly. The quality was pretty good especially for a costume. A lot of the time you get cheap costumes from a halloween store and they are thin material that is not comfortable and this far exceeded that expectation. With that being said, this isn't totally on the same level as what you might get from the Disney store, but still nice. Overall it worked really well. My child looked super cute as Minnie Mouse and the ears were cute though polka dot and not the traditional black with a bow. I would definitely recommend taking a chance.

  The faux leather is thick and feels like real leather; something you'd use in a stage production or cosplay, this is NOT cheap junk you'd use for 1 Halloween and throw away.Pros:  It looks great for the Plague Doctor theme.  Easy to adjust to fit.  Great quality.Remember that any full-face mask will restrict your vision significantly:  you can't drive and moving through crowds is challenging.  This one has plenty of ventilation holes along the bottom of the beak but the eye lenses can still fog up.At a party you'll spend more time with it off than on, but it does look cool.  If you actually have to visit someone with plague, this will keep evil spirits and miasmas away.

  GREAT Halloween costume! The fit was great. The quality of the product is amazing. I received nothing but compliments on how everything came together. One of the elastic pieces on the arms was not as strong as the other—so I had to hold it up using a hair tie—but not a big deal at all. Definitely worth the price. Not revealing on the top either, definitely very appropriate. Dress might be a bit short, but wearing tights (to complete the costume) helps a lot.

  Great Halloween costume, super cute and warm. As with anything by this brand, it will show your butt, so if you're wearing it to the office party, might want to throw on some leggings. This brand is meant to fit tight, so if you're between sizes it's probably better to err toward the larger size, especially if you're curvy.

  Great high quality costume! I got it for a space-themed party. It is sexy and comfortable. I am a size 6 (small on top, curvy on the bottom)- I ordered the medium and it was too baggy especially in the butt. I reordered the small and it fits much better. It’s a titch tight from shoulder to crotch, but the overall fit is way better. So if you’re a size 6-8 go with M but if you’re a 4-6, go S.

  When I got this, the elastic at the left leg was ripped and so was the top of the zipper so unless I held them tight, the air couldn't stay in and keep its form on its own. I didn't realize it until I bought another to get it in time for Halloween, but this was definitely already used when it had gotten to me. The actual new one that I actually used for Halloween, was nicely packaged in it's plastic, the little dinosaur gloves were tied together and with a label, there was a nice quality picture showing the costume, and it didn't have batteries yet.When I first opened the original, I was so excited I didn't realize that it was just jammed into its plastic and there were already batteries in it showing that some stranger had already put this on. What the hell. The original is going to be returned, but it was funny how the original costed about $60 and took maybe 2 weeks to get to me whereas the new one was available for prime so 2 days AND it was $10 cheaper so I at least had that going for me.The new one is great though, great quality and got lots of laughs and high fives from wearing though had to fix the zipper since it busted open the 3rd time I zipped it up.

  My son absolutely LOVES to dress up, and this police costume is one of the many Melissa and Doug outfits that he owns. I love the quality-- so much better than the junky fabric used in most Halloween costumes, and I am sure that it will hold up for much play and through many washings.  My only real complaint is the police radio/walkie-talkie. It is SO LOUD. There does not seem to be any way to adjust the volume. My son finds it unpleasant and so do his parents and probably even the people in the apartment below ours. The radio should come with the ability to turn down the volume, or should simply play at a lower decibel level.

  I am 5'6 weigh 130 lbs with a skinny build. The size on here says that if you are over 5'4'' you must get a large, but I think getting that would make the suit sag on me. I wear glasses and obviously it pops out in the eye area especially if you wear thicker frames. Probably not good for photos! But even then, if you don't wear glasses, the eye area is just too hard to see and it can irritate your eyes.

  I had ordered this costume with 2 day shipping since it was less than a week before Halloween and I wanted to make sure I got it. I live in Canada, and got it in just over 2 days. The material is good, the straps are a bit loose (but there is velcrow, im assuming to cross at the back to make it tighter.) Looks exactly as pictured. I originally thought M/L would be too big, but I knew S/M would be too small. I've tried on costumes at halloween stores (of this brand and others) and have figured out that they run small. I was looking through other comments and not many mentioned the sizing. So M/L is definitely a medium and a smaller medium at that and so forth with the other sizes. I'm 5'7, 135 lbs and a 34d. It fit me pretty well on the hips and in the chest. The dress is short enough to be sexy but not short enough to be too skimpy or uncomfortable. If you're over 5'9 or 5'10 I probably wouldnt recommend this costume. THE COSTUME DOES TURN YOUR SKIN PURPLE AND ANYTHING WHITE.

  I used this for my daughter for Halloween and it was a hit! It’s a super cute dress that fits true to size. The only complaint I have is that it does have a built in “leotard” bottom (think like a one piece bathing suit). Which is fine if you’re using this for dance but for Halloween I ended up cutting that part out (the skirt is sewn above it so you can cut it out without noticeable damage) because taking off the entire dress to go to the bathroom while trick or treating (and wearing tights because it was cold) was just something I didn’t want to do.

  Got a lot of compliments on it when it was working good, the fan isn’t really strong enough to keep the dinosaur aired up if you walk around very much, so it tends to deflate a little bit and you have to stop and let it reinflate. Also it fit quite small I’m only 5‘10“ roughly, and I had to crouch down a little bit in order to see out of the little window that’s on it. It also rubbed my four head raw because of the excess fabric where the Jolle meets the neck inside of the costume, it was constantly rubbing on my four head and not very soft at all. Since I wore it when it was cold out the viewing window fogged up constantly also making it hard to see. It’s still a very neat costume and gets a lot of laughs, my wife cries whenever she watches video of me in it because she can’t stop laughing, so there’s some good and some bad, but in this case I think the good outweighs the bad.

All items will fit into the jacket so your policeman or police woman always has all their supplies ready!

  They said to start wearing masks when you go out in public, so I got this one.I think it encourage social distancing :)Mask was easy to adjust and fit pretty well.  Will need a sachet for the nose to keep out smells and evil humours.  Eyes do tend to fog over on exhale, field of view is reduced (mostly in the front) but not as much as I thought it would be.  Comes flat; I have it propped open to help reshape it and to air out the new vinyl smell.  Feels sturdy.

  This was a SUPER cute costume!  But it runs very small.  I ordered a medium and the length barely covered my butt.  I’m 5’8” and  I range between a size 4 and size 6 in women’s clothing, and I am a bit curvy in certain areas.  Standing still it was okay but when I walked it kept riding up and I had to keep pulling it down all night.  Thank god for the jacket that came with it or it would’ve been a no go.The one other thing was that when I took it out of the package it was EXTREMELY wrinkled...it looked like someone had taken it out of the wash while it was wet, crumbled it up and put it in the packaging to ship out.  It says “do not iron” too!!  There was no way I could have worn it that way so I had to iron it...It took me 2 hours to try to iron it without scorching the material!!! I did scorch it in certain placed but that was way better than looking like a slob.  They need to at least attempt to fold it up so that it doesn’t arrive like that if they expect you to not iron it.  Other than that it was a great costume for the price!!

  My wife and I each ordered one of these. I am 6’3”, 210lbs and I ordered a M/L. For me the fit was pretty true to size, a little on the short size, the sleeves about 4 inches too short, and a bit tight in the shoulders, but it will work. My wife is 5’5” and 125lbs and she ordered a S/M. It was way too long for her in the arms and legs. For some reason the torso for the M/L and S/M are the same length, so the bottom of the torso sat at her knees. We could hem the arms and legs, but this was a deal breaker. Unfortunately, we will have to return hers. It was a good thing we did order two of them though, because mine came with two Maverick patches and hers came with a Goose and Maverick patch so we were able to correct the patches for mine. Hopefully she can find something that will work for her. We would order an XS, but the size chart indicates that it would be too small for her and I’m guessing the torso would be just as long.

  So, all in all it was well received. Lots of laughs. A couple of main points:1. You’d think it’s clear that you’re mocking the president, but it’s not. So a couple people were upset with me because they assumed I was pro-Trump. Which leads to...2. You’ve now invited political conversation on yourself for the entirety of the evening. Maybe that’s your thing, just be prepared.Even with all the laughs there’s a much larger downside: drunk men LOVE to punch trump in the face. Like, this alone will lead to fighting. I almost punched back after being hit in the balls for a second time. I also had drunk guys grab his head and force it into their crotch. Trumps head is basically one big target sitting just above your balls. Wear a cup, and be ready to brawl.Other than that, great costume!

Then open the velcro on the wrists so your hands can be out to finish dressing. If you don't have help, you will have to turn the costume to get it zipped. I hooked the battery pack to the collar of my T-shirt. It has an elastic head strap you put on, which is handy to keep the head upright.👉 BIG HINT: tie a string to the zipper pull tab, because the zipper is in the back. You're welcome.💥No kidding, folks... it gets hot in there. Make sure you have an escape plan for cooling breaks if you are wearing this at events.All in all, so far, I like it.😺

  Ordered a medium. I’m 5’3 & approx 120 lbs. the pants fit well on the waist, slightly baggy towards the ankles but not too noticeable. I have a small upper body so the top is loose but I expected it to be. All in all good for a princess jasmine or genie or belly dancer look. As you can see it arrived with one area on the arm slightly torn so I’ll have to fix that.  The material is thin but I also expected it to be.

  I've used this costume for the past two Halloweens. Looks great and it's held up quite well. It's also a really comfortable costume to wear to work for our annual costume day. Nice that you can be Goose or Maverick.That being said, it's a little bit short in the groin area. I'm 5'9"" 190 lbs, and it fits well, but I have to crouch a little when putting it on. Anyone taller than 5'10"" might have more trouble.Also, it's kinda difficult to use the restroom while wearing it. You have to unzip the whole costume, but it's not a deal-breaker. Woulda been nice to have a ""conveniently-located"" zipper though :)

  I bought a princess Aurora dress from the website momapprovedcostumes.com but I was afraid it would not arrive on time for the birthday girl. I bought the Relibeauty Auroa dress as back up for the birthday in case the other didn't arrive. Well the other Aurora dress did arrive on time, it was pretty and was more play friendly, had a simple 1 layer skirt with no puffiness to it which is a bit easier to play in it. But hands down the Reliabeauty Aurora dress was far more beautiful than the momapprovedcostumes dress. It was more princess looking with the tulle glitter overlay, tulle underskirt, no itch skirt linin, and vibrant pink shimmer colors. Both dresses had the shirt style top so it was easy for on/off.  I was sad that I couldn't keep both dresses, but with amazon's free returns I had to return the Reliabeauty dress. I was already in the whole for paying extra shipping on the momapprovedcostumes dress. Maybe when we outgrow the momapprovedcostumes.com dress I will re order the Reliabeauty dress because it's gorgeous, well made, and comfy and it was better priced.

  I am a size 12 pants, large or xl shirt. My chest is small but my shoulders and arms are big. My legs and calves are big. So this was a little tight in the butt area and the arms and back. But it actually fit id just need someone to zip it for me. If you are big in the arms or legs definitely try a large or bigger than that. Medium definitely would not have fit me.It’s cute and sexy and I like how the front flap kind of covers if you are a bigger girl and have a bit of stomach.Material stretches surprisingly.

  This costume is fantastic, I have to say. It wears well, and it does so for a good price. I was initially skeptical of buying this costume when originally shopping for a good Spider-Man costume. So, I read the reviews, weighed the pros and the cons, and looked at customer photographs before deciding to go for it. I have not been disappointed.I originally ordered this costume in, I think, October of 2016. Now, a year later, I am still enjoying the costume. I wore it to the Spider-Man: Homecoming premiere, and fans and friends alike enjoyed it! I also more recently wore it to a local community center play day for the kids. They enjoyed it immensely. And, as it comes to kids, I found myself doing all kinds of acrobatic things. I did hand stands, cartwheels, splits, and plenty of running around, and the costume has held up. And, at the premiere, I jumped onto things and off things (within good reason), and never had any issues with the suit. Definitely a win-win.Now, as others have said, the costume does have a red mesh where the nose and mouth are. And if someone is up close and personal, they will possibly be able to see your mouth and nose. It does, however, making breathing a bit easier, and doesn't detract from the overall appearance of the costume. And if you were to stand a few feet back, you can hardly notice it. The mesh for the eyes isn't the easiest thing to see out of, but it's not exceedingly impossible. In the daytime, anyhow. At nighttime, I probably wouldn't really attempt to walk around with the mask zipped up without a bit of help. Overall, not a deal breaker.I should probably also add that wearing an undergarment beneath your costume is probably a very good idea. I've stuck with a pair of compression shorts that aren't really visible and work well with the suit.One last thing regarding size-- we're probably all wondering ""will it fit me""? Having ordered another super hero suit, I found that the other suit was appropriately slim-fitting, but still a touch baggy in the waist area. So, I went with a smaller size. As a guy who is 5'6.25"" and 122 lbs, and who generally falls more into the large size category for a suit like this, I bought a medium instead. The medium is appropriately snug, but still allows for plenty of movement, and fits a bit better than my other super hero costume.All in all, if you're looking for a cheaper cosplay outfit or something to wear for Halloween or to conventions or birthday parties and events, this is definitely worth a buy. Perhaps not so much if you're looking for absolute screen-accuracy, but it definitely feels like you're stepping right out of the comic books the moment you put it on. Of course, the brighter colors probably help with that, and wonderfully so!

  This is a really good costume for th price. I was going for a less slutty look that would be similar to Mortal Kombat. It fit as expected. I ordered a large (I'm 5""7 and 170 with a proportioned hourglass figure). It was very low cut so I personally wore a front criss cross bralette under it. I looked pretty slim in it and the sash helps to cover problem areas. The leg and arm straps do not stay up that well, but that is expected. Just tie them tight and it will be less of an issue. You can also sew them into place or use safety pins.

  I ordered this for my husband for Halloween. He is going as Maverick and I bought the corresponding dog tags. It's a nice costume as far as fit and  quality goes (not amazing but not bad compared to many Halloween costume quality standards), but the product description as well as the bag it came in says it includes both Maverick and Goose name tags. Ours only came with Goose. We checked the bag and all the pockets multiple times. Annoying. I don't have time to send it back or order a new one since we have a party to go to in 2 days so I will have to go buy a Maverick tag at the local Halloween store.

But most reviewers didn't keep batteries in the mega phone anyway because it was very loud and annoying.Megaphone aside I would definately recommend this to anyone.

  Ordered from begum9. Awesome experience! Expedited shipping was on time. I sized up according to reviews & wished I had not. I'm 5'4"" & 128lb. Usually wear a medium. The large is fine but a bit over sized looking. The belt I will have to alter because it's so large that it won't go around me. I'm just going to safety pin it. Easy fix. Super cute outfit. Jacket is a velvet material & very comfortable. The bowtie is also quite comfortable. The skirt & top are one piece & a silky thin material but the jacket will definitely keep you warm. Skirt alot longer then I expected. Goes down about 4 fingers above the knee. I want it just a bit shorter for socks to be displayed so I pulled it up in the waste & the jacket & belt covers that up very well. Perfect!  The hat came nicely folded so you do not have to fix it at all. Open it, take clips off & it bounces to it's perfect shape. I love everything about this costume. Exactly as picture. It will be used for years to come. I picked up the entire outfit & am very happy with it all. Worth buying & would recommend.

  I am 6'3"", lets say 199lbs.  I usually wear a 38waist.  Even though the sizing chart told me otherwise....I ordered the Medium/Large and it fits pretty good.  Plenty of room in the waist,  (the waist size chart is not accurate...luckily), a bit tight in the crotch, the arms are an inch or 2 shorter than I would of liked, but the legs are long enough so I'm happy.  I can always roll up the sleeves if need be..  Now that I think about what shape person this was designed for?....someone who is tall and has long legs and disproportionately short arms.  Impressed with the quality of the fabric.  Not your standard costume crap.  Fully functional pockets too.

  Beautiful well made dress. My three year old loves it! I bought a size 5 and it actually fits her fine(she’s a little tall) so I would say it runs slightly small. The glittery decoration on the skirt is so pretty and doesn’t shed glitter. I was worried about the mesh sleeves getting holes easily but my daughter has been pretty rough with them and they have held up. Nothing has been damaged or come off of the dress and we got it two weeks ago, she wears it often. I’m very happy with the value from the cost. It’s a gorgeous dress.

   I am not sure why the only bad review for this says that it is bad quality. I was disappointed that for the price it didn’t even include some really cheap boxing gloves, because those are expensive elsewhere. The fabric is actually good quality; very stretchy, no loose threads, and the fabric is extremely breathable. The shorts on the model look like mini shorts, but the shorts on me actually fit like underwear. I would give it a 8/10.

  I wanted to buy my 3 yr old who loves to dress up something other than tutu's and princess dresses so I went with this policeman costume.  I know others have complained about the buttons falling off and I do expect that will happen with time however my experience with costumes and dress up clothes is that they're often made cheaply and flimsy which I do not find this one.  The jacket material is thicker than any other dress up clothes that I have seen.  I think the quality is wonderful when comparing it to other dress up clothes.  I also think it'll help teach my daughter that girls can be more than just pretty princesses.  She'll love it.  I can't wait to give it to her for her birthday.  Every day is dress up day in our house so I am sure it'll get a lot of use!

Something I was concerned about since it was made of fleece was fuzz balls forming/attaching all over it.

  It is outstanding, and more fun than you can imagine possible with a costume.  It seems durable and still seems as good as new after two full days of use.  The fan works well to keep the costume inflated, and it serves the dual purpose of keeping you nice and cool so that you do not sweat from wearing a costume.  It fits well even though I am 6' 3"".

  Geeat costume & for once ever - actually looks exactly like the picture! The jacket is beautiful & I would have given it 5 stars for the quality/look/ cost balance but there's a chunk of bundled/knotted up black thread from the stitching on the outside of the jacket on the top of the shoulder in plain sight, which is a little disappointing. I'm afraid to alter it, for fear of losing major threading & creating a hole... but it's by no means a deal breaker.

  So, my husband and I purchased 2 of these for Halloween costumes along with 3 of the kids' ones. Hilarity ensued. I can honestly say there wasn't a single person who didn't laugh their butt off when they saw us all. My husband, who is 6'5"" was stretching the upper limits of fitting in this costume, but it's honestly easy to accomplish because the feet dangle and cover up a lot of space. I'm 5'9"" and it fit me just fine. It was easy to put on, and pretty warm which was perfect for our cold Halloween. The only part of this costume I didn't enjoy is the viewing screen for your face. It's a great idea in theory, but in practice it fogs up REALLY fast and makes seeing in the dark a little difficult. Also, should your child spill their pumpkin full of candy on the ground... well... just imagine 5 t-rexs with tiny arms trying to pick up all the candy in the dark. Nuff said.

  Mine arrived today and I've only worn it once but I LOVE it. I'm about 5'7 & 155lb and I bought the Medium. It is literally a 2nd skin. Good thing is that it is very breathable! I never felt suffocated.I gave it 4 stars because It fits almost perfectly. The fingers look short but feel fine. The red on the torso is long and the tip at the bottom of the belt is below my waist. (It actually lines up with my bulge, so it looks like its pointing at my crotch). Also, the face mask is very tight. The material presses against my eyes. (I have a flat nose, which probably doesnt help). I'm going to see if i can find a face mask/plate to wear underneath the mask. Also, minor nitpick-- the webbing on the costume does not line up perfectly along the seams. (I.e. the side of the mask).Regardless of the flaws, i love it and may even buy their Amazing Spider-man 2 costume. I definitely recommend this suit!

  My son LOVES this outfit! He loves it so much that I purchased two more Melissa and Doug role play sets the following day! It was very large on my 3-year-old but the sleeves and legs have elastic ends, allowing for a secure fit around the wrists and ankles. This also fits my 7-year-old nephew perfectly! The helmet is a little too big for both of them but it was something easy for my husband to fix. I wish Halloween costumes were made this well and this reasonably priced! Oh, I almost forgot to mention my favorite part: It's machine washable!!

  Okay my daughter was tooooo freaking cute in this costume, I loved it, all the people we saw loved it, she did not love the hat so much. it made it very difficult for her to see, to the point where I held up the nose for basically 2 hours trick or treating. What I wish I had known is that I could safety pin it to the rest of the costume to prevent such an annoyance. Alas I had no safety pins and neither did any of the houses we trick or treated at, or so they said. Should have tried it on before Halloween I guess.

  This costume is decent for the price.  The material is a bit thin so my husband wore thin pajamas underneath it.  It's a bit big, but it is somewhat adjustable.  (There is a velcro strap near the waist on the back that can be adjusted and there are velcro straps on the cuffs - they look good).  We also were able to hand wash and dry it in the dryer without it falling apart - so that was a plus.  My husband is 5' 9"" and weighs 167 lbs.  We ordered the Medium/Large.

  I purchased this for Halloween and it grabbed everyone's attention!  I also won best funny costume that day!  People just laughed all the time when they saw me tried to make copies or scan documents.  It is tough to use those little T-Rex 2 fingers to type email address on the scanner.  But I can take them off on my desk to type regular work.  If you worry about T-rex head is extended and may not able to fit in your cubicle, simply put the head on top of the monitor to rest so your eye level will be same to the monitor through the view window of T-rex.  It indeed was hot inside so you need to keep fan on all the time to feel cool down.  When you sit down on the office chair, just make sure to put the fan/wire on the side of waist so it operates well without you sitting down on it.  I am 5'2 I bought standard and it fits well except the leg.  It doens't full cover to my feet (See photos).  TuTu and the bow on the neck were not with the costume.

  The costume itself in regards to design is amazing.  We had purchased this for a big costume party and sadly my grandson was unable to wear it that day because the zipper broke after he tried it one, it was unrecoverable because the quality of the zipper was very cheap.  We had planned to return it but our grandson had his heart set so much on wearing it for at least Halloween night so I bought a 45 inch zipper (which cost about $8 plus a bit of effort on sewing for 10 minutes) and we modified it to fit perfectly in place of the old one.  Not only did this fix fit perfectly, it enhanced the design of the costume.  We had a happy ten year old who wore it on Halloween and was getting compliments left and right!  It was a hit and with the new zipper, we feel it may last us for years to come.  I gave this two stars but if they had the zipper we used, maybe 5 stars...but overall, nice costume but poor cheap product of a zipper and not convienent experience with bad timing.  {Look at Brown Zipper on Front}

  This looked GREAT in the photo.  Quality wasnt too bad (except the cheesy ""necklace) but it didnt look good on me.  I'm middle aged and a bit heavy.  I saw a picture of an older guy wearing it and he looked pretty good so I thought I would try it.  The headpiece just lies over the top of your head.  I felt like it needed to come up just a bit before going over and back.  Plus the ""skirt"" was way to big.  I could have pinned it if I had liked how the outfit had looked.Unfortunately, I tried on the top and bottom to see what the fit was like as soon as I got it but I didnt put the whole outfit on.  This meant, as I was getting ready to go to the party, I realized I didnt like how it looked on me and ended up having to return AFTER Halloween instead of before.  I knew they would think I was just trying to get a ""free"" Halloween outfit but at this price, I decided to do it anyway.  I have to say, they did accept the return, that's why I gave 3 stars instead of 1.  It should be noted however that they charge about $5.50 for return postage.

  I got this for next Halloween. I work at a bilingual preschool and the kids love it when you dress up. Last Halloween I was a unicorn, and this Halloween I'll be a monkey. It's so cute because you can even wrap the tail around your wrist and that holds it up. So comfortable to! You can't go wrong on this one!

  I've been purchasing ReliBeauty princess gowns for my little grand-princess for several years, and they have always been beautiful and beautifully sewn.  She is fast growing out of her ""princess stage"", but these dresses are so well made, and there are other little princesses-in-waiting who will be able to wear them, and they will then be able to  pass them on to the next little princess-in-waiting.  They are well worth the money.  If you think you can run one of these costumes up on your sewing machine Grandma, go ahead, give it a try.  But they'll never come out as nice as these.

Didn't win the costume contest, but, everyone told me I looked AWESOME under the lights on stage - I just sparkled all night! Giggity! Shirt was a little large, and, after playing drums with it on for a bit, it stretched some more, and eventually I had to re-button the sleeves above my forearms in order to keep them from catching on everything.

  My 3 1/2 year old says this has been his favorite Christmas present!!! (and he got more than any child needs)  He wears it just about all day every day. My only complaint is that the accessories don't stay on their velcro loops very well, especially the fire extinguisher. I hear all day, ""Mommy, will you put this back on for me?""  Otherwise, everything seems to be of good, durable quality and we are pleased with the purchase.UPDATE (11/2016): My now 5 1/2 year still occasionally  plays dress up with this set.

  How adorable is this? We had a costume day at school, and this was perfect. Excellent quality, it rivals Disney costumes.  It is soft and comfy.  However-I did cut the built-in leotard pants out. I couldn't see taking off the entire costume every time she needed to go to the bathroom!? It was an easy fix.  She wore black tights and white cotton bloomers.  In the pic she is wearing a black cardigan over it, and I bought the real Disney ears on Amazon. We also layered a full slip with tutu skirt that she already had for comfort and to give more pouf to thr skirt.Fit: granddaughter is 2 1/2, 36"" tall, 29 pounds, and 2-3 fit perfectly with a little room.  I think the 3-4 would have fit ok, but I didn't want to risk the 3-4 being too long and detracting from the pouf skirt.

  This dress is absolutely perfect and the quality is awesome compared to what you find in the stores.  I can't recommend it enough.  We purchased it for our daughter who was having a makeover at Disney's Bippitybop Boutique.  The fairy godmothers kept complimenting on how much they loved the dress and even grabbed one of the over priced Disney ones to compare and thought this was better made and looked closer to the Aurora dress.  They loved how the shoulders were designed!  Overall, very satisfied and would buy again if needed.  Our daughter now uses it for dress up and it has held up better than any other play clothes!

  This is almost too cute for words! I bought this for my 5 year old as a Christmas gift when she requested ""bad guy stuff"". After a lot of questioning we figured out she wanted to handcuff and ticket bad guys and I began to look for a police officer outfit. She is 48"" tall and wears a size 7/8. She is really slim but this entire outfit is such a good fit on her and she still has another year or two she will be able to wear it. It is not so big it looks sloppy and the blue is so bright and beautiful. The hat fits her really good and she has a big head. I like that it is gender neutral because she has a 4 year old brother that might like to play with it someday. She carries her own dry erase marker with her ticket so she can mark and erase the offense. She really loves the whistle and laughs like crazy when she handcuffs her big sisters. I also like that it did not come with a gun. If you want your child to have one with their costume that could be a separate purchase but since we try to teach gun safety I like not having one she can play with and maybe become a little too accustomed to seeing and using.

  This is basically a glorified BULKY hoodie. It’s long enough for leggings or tights to go under, I was under the impression it was more like a romper. The fabric is NOT flattering. It’s like Pajama fabric. The picture they use makes the model look cute and sexy, it’s really not - it’s bulky. Runs small, so order a size up.

  I bought this firmen's outfit because the one I have from another brand is so cheap, I was afraid it would fall apart before Halloween.  Wow what a difference. This Melissa and Doug brand is made from real cotton/polyester (11% / 89% respectively). It's made really well, and I can see years of use from it. The helmet is strong and really thick for a ""play"" outfit. The megaphone is just as sturdy and I see there is a screw to open it for batteries, and a little push button.  Haven't tested that out yet...just amazed at the quality of everything!  Even the silk screened ""Fire Chief"" on the back of the jacket is done with quality...thick ink and no gaps in the silkscreen.My son is 4, but tall for his age. The age for this jacket says 3-6, but I can see it being snug for an average 6 year old.  Otherwise, really great!!

It works just like a zip-up robe (something I'll probably re-use as once Halloween is over). I'm 5 ft and it hits an in or two above my knees. Quality is good, but it is thick (fleece like material)! Be prepared to sweat if you're going to a crowded party. The costume is super cute. I actually go inspiration from another reviewer to have my husband dress up as a banana!

This is the only seller from whom I will now buy princess dresses. Terrific value for price. I bought a size 5 for my  3 1/2 -foot tall, 42 pound granddaughter, and it's a great fit (including length). There is just a bit of room from growth, but I wasn't buying for room to grow. If you're looking, don't think twice. BUY IT!!! Also, dress was delivered on time. I also purchased a different style for other granddaughter, and had just as many great things to say about that dress as I did this one. For those wondering, I think the dresses probably run pretty true to size, I bought 3T-4T in the other dress for the granddaughter who wears a 4T.

  I bought this for my son for Halloween and then to play with after. He loves it! My son is 2.5 years so the vest and hat were big on him which is fine. I knew that would be the case due to the recommended age but he can grow into it. My only compliant is that the safety goggles were so tight on his face. They leave red marks around his eyes.

  The only reason I'm not giving this a five star review is because the material on the jacket is a little so so. I believe hanging it out and letting it fall it will look better and I made steam it. But it is a very adorable mad Hatter costume. Fits well on a small to medium frame to 21-year-old. The hat accessory could be a little bigger based on the picture It's a bit smaller than it appears in the picture and is a little flimsy or than I would like. Overall I am satisfied

  This is the first halloween in my 35 years that I didn't wear something hand made. I just didn't have time this year, so I bought this.I have a degree in costuming, and I have to say I'm impressed. While there are a few small tweaks (like reinforcing the underside of the tail against abrasion, adding foot stirrups, and adding some ventilation holes in the mittens, which I would tack to the sleeves) I would make, overall I am very pleased.It looks really derpy, and I kinda love that. BUT you can make it look more scary and realistic if you lean forward. Bent at the hip till you are looking through the very top art of the face window, the shape actually resembles a dinosaur more than a cartoon. I did this a few times, but it's hard on the back. Mostly I embraced the derp.I had so much fun threatening all the other dinos at our halloween parade (you have to have a plan for meeting other people dressed just like you!). We amused many as we had tiny armed battles (our huge heads prevented any real contact) and a few decided to be friends and we danced, which more people loved.Some wearing notes: It's a bit of learning curve getting in without worrying you'll blow the zipper (I get my feet in, crouch down, and flip it over my head, then zip up) but once it inflates (a minute or so later) it's roomier than you'd guess in there. Tons of head room for me (5'6"") . Now here's the downsides: it's a greenhouse. In the sun, you are baking. The window fogs up and you can't see anything but colored blurs. There is no ventilation in the mittens, and they practically fill with sweat. I'm cold-blooded. I like being warm... This is a bit too warm for day use of more than an hour. At night it was GREAT. My feet got cold, but the rest of me was comfy.The fan gave me about 6 hours of battery life over 4 days of use. Not great, but sufficient. Be aware that you need a tiny screwdriver to change the batteries, so be prepared for this with spares and tools.

  My daughter freakin' loves this thing. Its well made and it fits her perfectly. She's two but she's tall. She has worn it for weeks before and after Halloween. The front of the skirt was a bit long for her. She is about the size of a typical three year old, from what I've seen of them, and I say this because I want other parents to be aware that it may touch the floor. This was not a problem, for the most part. The bottom layer of the skirt has begun to tatter and she tripped on it a couple of times, so I hemmed it up a bit. It is a wonderful costume. Everyone said she was the best witch they'd seen. (from what I saw, it was the best costume, though). I would absolutely buy this again.

  For the most part, I love Melissa and Doug products. My 3.5 year old grandson is into dress up these days, so he chose this Fire Chief costume. Everything is great except for one little detail that I have no idea how to fix! The bullhorn and the fire extinguisher are affixed to the coat with velcro straps, and the bullhorn sort of hooks onto the strap ok, but the fire extinguisher is VERY hard to wrap the strap around, I think because the strap is the exact circumference of the toy. Otherwise, my grandson loves this, especially the shiny badge that comes with it.

  I dread shopping for Halloween costumes because adult costumes do not fit me well, but teen/tween costumes look too juvenile for my taste. For reference: I am 5'4'', 100-103 lbs, and wear 25 W 32 L in Levi's jeans. I actually tried on this exact costume in a size XS in the Halloween store and it was a little loose along my legs and torso. I thought to look online and see if there were smaller sizes and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they carried this in XXS! Finally! An adult costume with a wide range of sizes!!First off, this costume fits me like a glove! It's so sexy while remaining classy and no part of the costume is see-through even though the fit is a tight bodysuit. For the price, you get 5 items which is well worth your money. The torso length was not too tight on me and there is enough stretch to fit someone taller than me. Additionally, the leg length is quite long with extra room at the bottom to spare, so it can fit people that are just as skinny but with longer legs. I have skinny arms to accompany my skinny legs, and the gloves also fit me perfectly without slouching down! The mask is just as comfortable and well-fitting (and perfectly on theme for the pandemic). All in all, I highly recommend this costume!

  I'll start with a positive, the suit COULD look amazing.The fan I received with the suit was very underpowered I had to really fuddle with it to get it to even turn ON. And it was already attached which it was NOT supposed to be per the instructions... Leading me to believe I received one that had been returned by someone else, along with the fact the suit was not folded at all but rather crumpled up and stuffed in.I have a friend who had bought one, so I know how inflated it should STAY while moving. My costume struggled to stay inflated while walking.DO YOU KNOW what its like to have an entire children's birthday party get depressed at you because of a faulty costume?!Why did I get someone else's return?!I'm livid...

  While many people will boast of Melissa and Doug's high quality toys, I often find their products very hit or miss. In my experience a lot of their toys are great conceptually, but fall short with sloppy, chipped paint jobs and/or lack of durability.That said, this costume is a clear winner for Melissa and Doug. The fabric quality and stitching for this fire chief outfit is top notch, and the added bullhorn and extinguisher are just the icing on top. This outfit isn't like anything you'd find at Party City (where costumes fall apart after wearing them just once). It's beautiful, bright, fun and a total bargain for $25. Pottery Barn Kids sells a similar outfit for three times this amount.My 3.5 year old will probably get a year or year and a half of fun out of this before he outgrows it, but I know I'll save it for his baby brother to enjoy someday too. The fire extinguisher and bullhorn aren't as sturdy as the jacket and hat, but they're in good shape so far after countless falls on hard floor.

The material as to be expected, kind of cheesy and cheap but for a costume for a couple nights it works. It was a bit wrinkly so definitely prepare for that ahead of time. It didn’t come with the petticoat, but I highly recommend purchasing one,if not it’s flat and if you search Amazon you can find one cheaper than what they try to pair it up with under the costume.Overall I am very happy with my purchase i’ll definitely be recycling this for future Halloween‘s.

  Ordered this for my grandson and he loves it! Unfortunately the hat is the part he likes the most and it didn’t work right out of the box. There is an inner band that is meant to be adjustable but it does not stay closed no matter what size it is adjusted to. In addition, the band is supposed to stay inside the hat and it just falls right out of the homes it is supposed to slide into. Try explaining to a toddler why his new hat doesn’t work.

  I purchased this for my son's Halloween costume. All of the costumes on Halloween sites looked really cheap even though they cost more than this one. I love Melissa & Doug toys, and this costume is just as great. It is very well made. It launders well, and the extras, (fire chief helmet, a ""fire extinguisher"", a bullhorn with sound effects, and a shiny badge), are all great. I would recommend this to anyone who has a firefighting-loving child. I just realized though, that we haven't figured out how the bullhorn actually makes noise - that is probably a good thing.

  I loved this costume. I wasn’t sure what size to get based on reviews saying it runs small. I ordered size small/medium, it fit perfectly. I’m about 140 lbs, just for reference. The dress is a little short but I wore it with fishnets and boyshorts under which helped keep the dress down and helped to make sure I didn’t show too much. The garter and arm band were too tight but I have big thighs so I’m not shocked lol I didn’t really like the gloves so I chose not to wear them. I did try on the next size up to see if it fit better. It was perfect length wise but it was huge around the waist. Overall I’d definitely recommend this costume.

  This costume is so fun and hilarious! Our 9 year old had to have it for Halloween and we were excited to order it because it’s the kind of costume you can use all year long for fun. It’s not a one time thing.BUT, this thing gets super hot inside. It was pretty cold and misty on Halloween and our son ended up taking it off 1/2 way through the night trick or treating. He thought he was going to pass out. The window to see out kept fogging up and when I unzipped him, he was drenched in sweat head to toe!So, my advice for parents is this is not a good costume for trick or treating. It’s great for playing around and making funny videos for short periods of time. It’s not something you can keep on for more than 30 minutes.My son is 4’9”, 80ish pounds and we bought the teen size fyi

  We have a Fireman outfit that my Grandson plays with all the time. Purchased this Police outfit and the first thing he wanted to do was put Grandpa and me in handcuffs. Unfortunately the handcuffs aren't big enough for adult wrists. After he realized how hard it is to try to get the handcuffs to close, he lost interest quickly. He is only 4 so hopefully he will become more interested as he gets older. He did like the whistle for a short while. The walkie talkie makes sound but no one can understand what it says.

  I have mixed feelings about this costume. First, it did run a little smaller but I anticipated that so that wasn't a big deal but this thing shed like crazy. It shed so much that it does say you shouldn't wash it, thankfully it was a one time use situation. I also didn't leave my baby in it too long because of the shedding, I didn't want him to get itchy. When it was on it was very cute, I just wish it was better quality.

  I was not impressed with this outfit. This is basically just a black zip-up fleece hoody with yucky ""fur"". It was very unflattering on. Although I appreciated it's warmth while going house to house with the kids, it was oddly shaped- tight in some areas, too long & too big in other places. The hood was also very big and too floppy & oddly shaped to be much use. The ""fur"" around the hood was scratchy & messy & after wearing it for 2 hours I was completely broken out in a nasty itchy red rash all over my face, neck & chest. I definitely did not feel like I looked like a bat let alone a sexy one. In fact, I also felt like I appeared to be 10lbs heavier. This costume was a huge disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it.

  This costume is the best.  I wore it to three different parties and functions this weekend alone. Everyone loved it and thought it was the best.  I completely shadowed my wife's costume as well (see pic).One item of note, I preferred my arms under the aliens arms for 2 reasons.  1, it was easier for me to rest my arms against my own body and 2, if I put my arms over top the aliens, it made the alien arms bend more outwards making it appear to not hold me and it cut off air flow supply so the lower part of the arms deflated a bit.

  i was nervous to order a costume online just because they normally dont fit my body correctly, but the reviews were pretty good so i decided to chance it and order anyways. I actually got lucky and caught it while it was on sale for $36.99 last week:) i can agree with previous reviews that smaller women left. the legs of the bodysuit are a little big but everywhere else fits pretty damn good. I'm 5'7 and about 140 pounds, the small was my best bet. i will note that once you get the body suit up on your shoulders, it does make the bottom look less baggy. i personally think its a bit too revealing not to wear any panties at all so i will be wearing a black or nude thong with mine. overall its a good costume and all my friends love it. cant wait to wear it next week.

  The costume arrived quickly, which was appreciated. Its important to note that only the front of the costume has the patchwork print, the back is just a solid pink. I wonder how much money the manufacturer saves by not using the print for half the dress? If it was going to be solid, it would have been better for it to be a dark color. The dress did start to run in more than one place at the bottom where the dress is cut in a jagged cut (it is not hemmed) and this was after just wearing it once. The quality is not the best for what it costs, but perhaps that is what you expect of a halloween costume. Maybe we should expect more. My daughter was still excited to have a Sally costume.

Honestly I feel a couple inches too short for it, but once I put my arms in the sleeves then it adjusts and fits perfectly. Plus, any extra height is made up for in the legs :) OH! And I can wear shoes with this, which I thought was a super cool touch. The only thing I'd say is, make sure to pack an extra set of batteries. It seems to burn power somewhat quickly, but 4 batteries seems to have lasted me quite a while still :)Super happy with this purchase!! Would 10/10 buy this again.

I will wear it as a jacket over another costume (duel costumes, if you will). I recommend this if you will be outside. It's very warm and 'cozy' for sure. I'm keeping it as a bathrobe or to lounge around over pjs in. I just wish it had pockets! For reference- I'm 5'4, size 8. XL goes to my knees and can layer underneath.

  I was extremely happy with this product.  I bought it because my daughter wanted to be a fire fighter for Halloween, but all of the normal Halloween costumes had reviews that the material was thin... I figured they were just more like one-time-use items.  This had other good reviews about quality, and I was not disappointed.  It is made better since it is for year round dress up, not just one night.  Plus it is made well because Melissa & Doug is a good brand.The hat is made of hard plastic (not the really thin plastic kind you get at a dollar store) and it is sizable, which is great for my small daughter.  The jacket is thick and has real reflective material on it.  The bullhorn requires a couple of batteries (not included) and makes noise (it does not amplify the voice though).  The fire extinguisher is a nice size.  The cap is removable, so my daughter wanted to put water in it and use it like a squirt bottle, but it doesn't do that, which is probably for the best :).  It has a cute little badge and a place to write the child's name, which is fun.The size is good.  My daughter is 4 and very small for her age, and she does ""swim"" in this, but it doesn't look extremely big on her.  She will play with it after Halloween as a dress up outfit for a long time!

  Nicely made, fun to play with. Bought it for a 3 year old. The speaker and the extinguisher are held in place by velcro straps which an adult has to strap back on each time they are taken off. Could have been a better attachment method so a child could just slide them in and out themselves. My 3 year old is tall for his age. He won't fit into this in 6 months.

  I've worn it as a jacket; it's great for a chilly day, though probably not for a ""freezing"" one. It's a bit snug, but not in a constricting way. Short on my arms, though I'm long-limbed so that wasn't unexpected. Major plus on the length; it goes past my bottom and I have a long torso, too. The biggest drawback is the lack of pockets and somewhat restricted movement due to the wings (which was an issue mainly when buckling into the car).I'm going to wear it as often as possible.Bonus: I didn't notice it in the pictures so I was pleasantly surprised at the thumb-claw!

  My 4 year old loves his fire outfit!Melissa & Doug toys solve problems that other similar toys have.One example is the fitting straps on the inside of the helmet. These plastic straps always break, and the kids wear the helmet anyway. On other products – if the straps get ripped out of the helmet there are sharp plastic edges left behind that can cut. On the Melissa & Doug fire helmet, the fitting straps on the inside are actually removable and there are no sharp edges at all.Another example is that it’s all washable.Melissa & Doug toys are going to last longer than other similar products.

  My daughter LOVES the doctor kit. The pieces all fit nicely in the jacket; which is very well made!  The heartbeat stethoscope was a huge hit, as many of the more inexpensive doctor kits we have purchased in the past, simply did not do anything.  Only complaint from my daughter was that the Doctor Mask does not fit comfortably around her ears.  The company tried to make it adjustable (which is great), but the Velcro tabs that are being used are very scratchy against the ears if it turns slightly.  Otherwise, definitely worth the price!!

If you're buying this for a one time Halloween outfit outside, it's fine and very pretty.

  I don’t like the long front “tail” on the “skirt”. Other than that this is a nice costume. I’m 5’7”. 29” waist, the XS is about right could be a little smaller though and it would fit better. Normally I’m a small. These run VERY large. The necklace is a joke. If you want one, just find another, don’t bother with the one that’s included.

  I am usually impressed with the quality of Melissa and Doug products... however this costume was not quite what I expected, the top was thin cotten.  It says its for a 3-6 year old but the top was very small, wouldn't fit my 4 year old, I wish it had been a vest or short sleeved but the sleeves were way to short.  Also the hat fell apart in the package, I didn't experiment to see if I could get it back together since I was already planning to return.  It would have been OK if it was sized correctly.

  It is a very well made dress.  I wasn’t expecting it to be so good looking because it is a costume.  For me it was comfortable to wear at a costume party.  I received so many compliments.It is super long, I am only 5’2, but I bought the thing that was recommended to poof out the dress.  While it still fit long, I did wear heels and that fixed it.  I do recommend buying the skirt that goes under to poof it out just to give it the effect.  I also bought the gloves.Other reviews said it was wrinkled which it was, but the iron took out those wrinkles.  I was able to use the iron directly on the fabric, but I first ironed it with a pillow sham on top just to test if the fabric would hold up with the heat.A medium fits 36C bust, 28” waist.

  I'm 5'10 and 150 lbs. with a 34B bust. After reading the reviews, I decided to order a large instead of a medium. I'm happy with the fit--snug but not too snug. I probably could have ordered a medium, but the sleeves already seem short to me so I can't imagine how short they would be if I sized down. The dress does come down a bit further on my legs which is nice. Again, I probably would have been ok in a medium but happy with the large. I didn't look at the dress sizes on the size chart, they seemed way off. I just went by measurements.

  The dress is beautifully made. The craftsmanship and material quality is more than what I had expected. It’s design is actually closer to the actual Aurora/sleeping beauty character. Better than the one from the Disney store and almost half the cost. I love it. My daughter is thrilled. I got the size 4/5 for my taller than average three year old and it fits perfect. It is floor length with a bit of a poof which gives the total princess ballroom gown look. Not flat and not overly poofy. Just right. I just wish the cotton lining of the dress would be a bit thicker, but so far it protects from the scratchiness of the tulle layer.

  I told myself I was going to dress warm and comfortable for Halloween this year and then I came across THIS costume. LOVED IT. and so did everyone else. I went on a bar crawl and so many random girl groups commented on how amazing I looked! Instant confidence booster!Only cons are that the cloth piece that hangs between your legs is loooooong. I’m 5’5” plus I wore 3 inch heels and I was still stepping on it throughout the night. Also, there are two pieces— a stretchy shear gold body suit, and then the black and gold main piece that zips up on the top piece. So going to the bathroom is kind of a big ordeal because you have to get unzipped and THEN get the whole body suit off.....but if you stick to shots you won’t have to pee as much XDI still recommend this outfit if you want to turn heads and slay! It’s bold and unique, I didn’t see anyone else wearing it among all the other sexy cats, cops, and female superheroes.

The costume and the accessories are all of really good quality for the price.

This costume was bought last year and still in excellent condition.  I was concerned the size wouldn't be right.  He is small so it is a little big on him.

  Awesome costume! Just got it in the mail and immediately my husband tried it on. Such great quality for the price, I was very surprised. The fit is a bit weird, the top back half is a different material, great for stretching. But the top is slightly bulky, if you're slimmer definitely size down but it'll be an easy fix with some safety pins. The pants are scrunched up a bit on the sides and seem to fit a bit snug which is totally fine but looks a lil off with the top being bulky, again easy fix. It came with everything, the gloves are very tight and the seam already started spreading in between the fingers but I'm sure that was my husband's big hands fault.

  Looking for something to wear for Pirate Night on a Disney Cruise. This worked out well. I normally wear a 14-16 in dresses. The dress was great. It was very comfortable and not hot. The belt was a bit small. Seemed like it was for a smaller size. Had to modify it just a bit with extra Velcro and safety pins. If it weren't for the belt, I'd have given it 5 stars.

  This was cute, and my child was excited to wear it, but it Is disappointing. It runs really small, and was difficult to get on. Within 30 minutes of putting it on half the skirt had torn away from to top. So here we are, on Halloween, attempting to pin this thing together so we can get through trick or treating before it all falls apart.

  We bought this for my son's 2nd birthday and he loved it.  The quality of the materials is very good and it feels like it will last for a long time.  The only thing I don't like about it is the Velcro loops on the sides of the jacket.  They are difficult for him to put the bullhorn and extinguisher back into.  Older children would have no problem though.  I really like Melissa & Doug products and this adds to the list of great gifts I've bought from them.

  Wow! I bought this costume last year and LOVED IT! Not only was it completely inappropriate and offensive -- it fit really well too! J/K. We want this costume taken down!I thought wearing this costume would boil an entire culture down to a racist stereotype. And I was right: Turns out, I was representing the culture in a super inaccurate and unflattering way! We want this costume taken down!The best news: I wore the costume on Halloween to be funny. Then the next day I took it off, and I was just me again. Isn’t it awesome that I didn’t have to deal with the racism or oppression some people actually experience on a daily basis? Best Halloween ever! LOL BUT SERIOUSLY: take the costume down.

  This was the most money I had ever spent on a Halloween costume, but it looked high quality and it was the official Jurassic Park T-Rex and my son was going to have the same costume as his friends so there would be a bunch of dinosaurs running around. We tested it as soon as we got it. Worked as it was supposed to. Made him take it right off and kept it packed up until Halloween night. Halloween night, got to the friends house, he put his costume on. The other boys put theirs on, but only minutes later started having trouble with the fan not pushing enough air to fully inflate their costumes. The other dad sat and worked on them for about 20 minutes. While we waited, we went to the first house and while posing for pictures, my son's also started deflating. All 3 boys had to scramble and find some masks just to look like they did SOMETHING for Halloween. And my batteries were my ""good batteries"", brand new. There was no reason this should have ruined our Halloween night.

I'm 5'11"" and it is just a tad short in the torso, meaning if I lift my arms, it starts to rise up in sensitive areas but otherwise no problem.

  I'm so glad I ordered this product! I waited & debated, then Amazon went out of stock so I pulled the trigger once the item was a slightly higher price, almost out of stock & not prime & I don't regret it one bit.I'm a curvy, top & bottom & am 5'6. I ordered the large since I normally wears jean size 31/32 again curvy not super skinny jeans & it's perfectly tight around my waist.I also plan to wear with thick leggings or black jeans depending on the weather. So I tried on over my normal jeans for the review.It's a snug fit so if you're going for a looser super comfy fit then order 2 sizes up.The product hits me mid thigh, in the front. A little too short in the back for me to wear alone, but you could get away with it especially with a short pair of running shorts on underneath.Upon opening the shipping envelope I was slightly concerned it'd be tough fabric that wasn't soft as the packaging is a no frills basic Halloween packaging, but fabric is soft & comfy. Only a few strings from seeing to trim which is not a big deal at all.Also has the great V neckline, even if it's zipped all the way up it doesn't go above a what a normal v neck shirt would and the fur goes all the way down to the zipper. The zipper doesn't have a second pull from the bottom so don't expect that.The ears on mine stand up without adding any additional support as they are stuffed so full they have no option but to stand up.There are also nice details I was surprised by like the wing hooks off the sleeve and the stitching that outline what would be the bats bones in the wing.There is also a v that goes down in the front and back, almost like a onesie that's unbuttoned (if a one size was a V) to account for the bats body I guess.All in all I'm super happy with the purchase and excited for Halloween. A simple yet cute outfit that I can definitely wear year after year.I cannot confirm enough order a size or two up & order it before it goes out of stock if you're debating on getting it at all! 😊Will try to update with pics later.

  My roommate had a Halloween-themed birthday party during COVID stay at home, and this was the PERFECT last-minute costume. The lace-up detail in the front came laced only every few loopholes, and as a bustier girl, I didn’t feel comfortable with that amount of cleavage cover. It was super easy to lace it up fully for more coverage, though!Per recommendations on previous reviews, I did end up purchasing additional accessories and didn’t end up using the included headband.

  Ordered this for my almost 2yr old after him wearing similar set that was in the children's section of a museum went to. He loves and so do I! It is super cute and has room to grow so will have it for few years. It came in mail day early which was a plus because was rainy day. He's been wearing it on n off since. Made of good quality and like that the coat is machine washable. The hat is adjustable. The little fire extinguisher, blow horn (which makes noise), and badge make it complete. Also the little name card in front of the coat pocket makes it more personalized. Great price as well.

  Sadly, only one star because my kid couldn’t use it for Halloween. I ordered this costume several weeks ago and when my child was trying it on we discovered that the zipper was broken. I returned it and immediately ordered a new one. When the new one came in, there was once again problem with zipper alignment. It’s a different problem but it still has to do with how zipper is sewn in. So returning the second costume. Very sad, because otherwise this looked like a high quality item made of good material with sharp graphics. The only way to make this work if the zipper is broken is to completely and totally tape the zipper seam shot. If you make it airtight  enough with tape, you have a chance of it bowing up correctly... But in this case it is not suitable for a child because they would not be able to move around with tape all over. In any case, when you’re paying this much money for a costume, you wanted to work as expected.

  I hate to say we were pretty unhappy about this costume also.  It appeared cute in the picture, but when received, it was cheaply made and my daughter wasn't impressed (for a 4 yr old that's pretty bad).  It was very hard to get it wearable after it being crammed in an envelope from shipping due to the material it was made out of.  Also, the hat was a wrinkled, flat mess.

  The first one I ordered was much too small for a medium. I could barely zip up and was super short so I returned.  Just received the large and it was definitely used. Came wrinkled in an open package and the fur was all matted with lintel and hair on it. Normally when things are used they are sold at at discounted price. I would have given more stars if if came packaged and new like the first one. I made sure to nicely fold mine and put correctly back into the package, but someone should have checked the package before mailing the second one out, especially one that was open...

  Very cheap material to say the least, definitely will NOT fit up to what it says and I'm 2 sizes smaller than what they said they would fit in the waist and that's VERY disappointing.

  Love everything about this costume except no crotch opening in the body suit. They could make a velcro flap or something or a 2 piece underlayer. But I wore the body suit anyway and cut an opening in the crotch since I wouldn't be able to remove the whole costume to go to the bathroom. I liked the metallic aspect of the body suit. Someone could wear nothing or leggings instead of the body suit but I liked how it looked so I dealt with it. Otherwise would have been 5 stars!.

  I read a few reviews before I purchased this but I havent ran into any issue as of yet. I did read about the zipper difficulty but just a little bit of effort and you'll get it all set. Or if you have someone to just zip the back but I was able to do it by myself. Med size fit me for a thin build 5'10 / 140lbs. Your eyes remain pretty well hidden in the white eyes of the suit. The mouth area is thinner, but not very visible either. I believe it says so you can drink through it. Overall good costume

  The monkey costume arrived promptly and I just tried it on.  I am 5'3,"" 147 pounds and wear a size 10 jean. Oh, boy. The XL has me sucking in my gut when the sizing chart indicated a more roomy fit.  The face of the monkey is blemished with reddish marks and I can't tell if it's makeup (I don't wear makeup) or some kind of fabric dye....anyway, I tried to clean it with a toothbrush dipped in  a bit of laundry detergent but the mark seems to be permanent.  If it weren't so close to Halloween, I would request an exchange but I guess I'll just say the monkey is blushing. As people have mentioned, the tail is heavy so if this is a costume you want to use continually, consider replacing the stuffing with a lighter weight batting. Since I'm short, the hem fell to just above my knees.

  My three year old was thrilled when I told him his costume had arrived and we were both very excited to find this high quality jacket, hat, bullhorn, and extinguisher in the package.The coat is a thicker fabric with real reflective tape (a big plus since it will be his Halloween costume) that seems like it will hold up well for a while to come. The hat is also a thicker, hard plastic of good quality. The fire extinguisher is a good size and looks realistic though I wish you could squeeze the handle for the full effect. I haven't even had a chance to put batteries in the bullhorn yet but it is also a good size and seems like a quality product.He is a pretty average size three year old boy and the coat and hat both fit him well with room to grow into it without looking oversized. His only complaint is the hat is ""too heavy"" but he's used to a flimsy, plastic one he got at a party so that is relative.I don't usually write product reviews but this one really earned a shout out for being a quality product that was exactly what my son & I were hoping for!

  This is a great costume! Great material, hemming, details and durability. It was simply beautiful and i received so many amazing compliments. I wore this for a company party and had children coming up to me for pictures. so sweet!Other reviews are accurate that this is very long. I am 5'5, and even with 3"" heels, it still drug at least 3""+ on the floor. Unless you are 6', you will likely have to shorten this. Also, the upper portion is very stretchy to give you extra comfort, but don't let this fool you to get a smaller size. This is for comfort.To be helpful, I am a very curvy 5'5 woman. My measurements are 36 DDD chest, 33 waist, and 43 hip, and 188 lbs. I ordered a Large and it was perfect. I will emphasize that I have a small waiste compared to my other measurements and weight, and this is why the large was comfortable. This is a fitted look up top, so it you have a waiste larger then a 36, I would probably go a size larger to be safe.This did come with the headband and black necklace, I had to buy my own long white gloves.All in all, a super adorable and great for the price, costume.Oh, be aware, you will be shedding glitter everywhere you go. If possible, take this out of the package outside to shake out, or in a bath tub to rinse down. My bedroom was full of glitter, as well as my car. Lol

  I'm 5'11, 115 ibs and I ordered the small. It fit on the smaller side. This costume is super cute and I wore it with my boyfriend as a banana.its made of fleece, really warm for the cold. It was on the shorter side, so I wore brown leggings and long socks with bananas on them. The tail wasn't that heavy to me. It's about what I expected. However by the end of the night my tail had torn down the seem and stuffing was coming out of it and I had to tape it. That's why I gave a 4 star. But overall very cute and appropriate.

  My son has been living in this since I gave it to him.  We've had to wash it several times and it is holding up great so far.  The reflective strips did come off, but it did not leave any marks where they were, so it almost looks like they were never there.  The hat is a really solid piece of plastic, not like the flimsy hats they give away for free at firehouses.  I bought a second set for when he wears out this set since he loves it so much and it is such a great price.

  From a quality standpoint, the flight suit is surprisingly good, especially for a costume.  My only complaint is what others have noted -- the legs are simply too long.  In my case, I ordered a small-medium, and the the inseam measures 35 inches.  I can't imagine too many people ordering a S-M need an inseam that long.  And unfortunately from an alterations standpoint, the leg bottoms are finished with zippers, so it isn't just a simple matter of folding them up or hemming them.

  My almost 4 year old loves his construction costume. He doesn't seem to mind, but there are a few things that I think were poorly designed in comparison to the other M&D costumes we have. The pockets that hold the hammer and saw don't hold them upright and because there's no additional fabric behind them for stability, they continuously flop over and the tools fall out. Also, the inside piece for the hard hat (I'm sure there's a term for that piece) does not stay in the hat and does not stay fastened to stay on my son's head. We ended up taking that part out, and although the hat is now too big for his head without it, it's less frustrating for him to constantly have to ask for help to reattach it.

  I was disappointed with these costumes due to the look. They look much better in the picture than in real life.

  Melissa and Doug make great costumes, but I think this is their best. We have two and my kids use them a lot. We ended up with a second when I realized how favorably the doctor's tools in it compare with the doctor kit we have. It broke easily and this is holding up well. The coughing stethoscope is annoying, but you can leave batteries out. It's a great Halloween or everyday costume and has no gender indicators.

  Heads up on the sizing: as listed on package, Medium fits 5'0"" -5'4"", large is 5'5"" to 5'10"", X-large is 5'11"" to 6'3"". I originally ordered the medium but sized up after reading the package. Whew.Now that that's out of the way, this is the suit you're looking for. Unbeatable price. Plus, it is all one piece which means no losing gloves or awkward sneaker wearing with the suit. Spider-man will be cohesively himself. The eyes are easy enough to see from, but my long eyelashes are just a little bothered by the mesh so close. Obviously this isn't the manufacturers fault. One complaint is the way the feet fit, they were made too tight over the front of the ankle and will have to be worn in for a while before fitting perfectly. Picture added soon.The feet have a thicker fabric on the sole, but not to the extent that i would wear outside for extended periods of time. A friend has glued soles from watershoes under the feet of his suit, and that seems like the best way to go about keeping the authentic spidey look with a bit more foot protection.I would recommend a light shirt under the suit, as well as compression shorts or running shorts, for comfort and modesty. Not really the most covering outfit. That said, all in all it is a strong recommendation from me.

  If you're on the big & tall side like myself, you're probabaly hesitant to purchase this, especially since Halloween costumes historically run small. (I know I was!) however let me assure you that it does fit me just fine, and I even had some room to spare.That being said, The legs and arms have an elastic on them to keep the air in. This can be rather tight depending on how large your ankles/wrists are.Getting into the costume wasn't too bad at all; I was expecting much worse due to reading the other reviews. If I can do it being 6'2, I'm not sure what others were doing wrong. Here's what I did to get it on quickly and easily:-Lay costume on floor, zipper facing up-Insert legs into each leg opening-Crouch into a ball (hugging your knees)-CAREFULLY bring the costume up over your head-Once fully inside, ensure fan is on, and zip up-Finally, put hands through arm holes(Same process in reverse to take it off)Lastly, I will confirm what others have stated. It gets hot inside. Very hot. I only wore the costume for 5 minutes to test, and I was already sweating. Hopefully this won't be an issue since it will be colder in October.The costume seems to be well made, and all parts were included.Please excuse the poor picture - due to the Trex having short arms, they are inherently bad at taking selfies.If this was helpful, give a thumbs up. :)

  I wasn’t convinced wether I was going to like this or not but it had such great reviews. All in all it’s very flattering. My comments would be that the top seems good quality but the fabric on the leg part is thinner. I feel like you could probably see through it. It’s also not as slimming because of that. I like the tie details but you would definitely need to tack them down because they shift. I added a satin corset over it for more structure and detail. Very flattering on the bust line if you are larger. There’s no zipper so if you have to pee you have to pull the whole thing off lol. Fit was pretty dead on except the legs are long at the ankles and kind of bunchy. I’m 5’4” and 140lbs for reference.

  My five year old loves this costume so much he wore it to a costume party, for his birthday party and for actual trick or treating. There was no talking him into a different outfit. With that said, the costume has taken a LOT of damage. It has run through the washer so many times and it still looks like new.

  This is a great costume!! The only suggestion for people looking to buy this, is that it does run a bit small. I have read suggestions from others to go two sizes up your regular size. I am typically an XS or SM and I ordered a Medium. I am 5ft3in tall and it fit perfectly, not too short. It includes the dress, belt, hat with badge, as well as an additional badge for the costume itself, and the name plate. The hat was cheaply made and way too big for my liking so I went with a black baseball cap instead.

  According to the instructions, I placed his photo and name on the ID card provided before I gave it to him. I also threaded a ribbon through the whistle so he could put it around his neck. All evening my (almost 5 year old) grandson played with this after opening it on Christmas Day to the exclusion of all his other gifts. The back of the uniform says ""POLICE"" on it. It's pretty detailed, with stripes and big buttons that velcro together. I can tell that the manufacturer has put a lot of thought into what a child would like and how the uniform would really look. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another dress up costume as I thought it was well made and lots of attention to detail was paid.

  My son LOVES cars and this outfit was a hit. We initially purchased for a Halloween outfit, but it has become a constant in our household, regardless of what day it is. We love the fact that is has the racing stripes and patches as shown on actual race car drivers jump suits.  The foam steering wheel is a little odd, but my son doesn't play with that item, as he would rather have a car in his hand.He is 3 and while this suit is big on him, the elastic around the ankles and wrist allows him to wear it without tripping and prevent the sleeves from falling below his hands, so he will definitely be able to grow into this outfit. Another great plus... it washed well and has not faded and/or shrunk/lost shape. Definitely would recommend!

  I understand why this dress has so many awesome reviews! For the price the quality is amazing - compared to other ""Disney"" dresses that you can buy this is by far better quality. It is lined on the inside of the skirt. It is not made of scratchy material. The length is perfect, it is not too tight. I washed it in a laundry bag on cold, hung to dry and it didn't fall apart. The skirt is very full and falls well. It is a little challenging to get on - no zipper - goes over the head. My daughter is 3.5y - average build. Perfect fit.

  I love this product. I saw boxes of these at my warehouse job and just had to buy one for my little brother. He is three and he's big for a three-year-old and this fits him good and it will probably fit him good for another year. The only problem I had with it was that it comes with a fire extinguisher and the lid comes off. We had to super glue it shut because he kept putting things inside of it like dirt and bringing it back in the house. The lid is not the squirting kind either so I can't imagine why they did this but overall I love this product very high quality very durable.

  Really nice costume!! Like the description and other reviews state, you will need to buy the red petticoat separately to complete the look and make the dress fluff out correctly. I was scared it would be too big because of the ""S/M"" and ""M/L"" combined sizes, so I ordered an XS. I am 5'9 and ~135 lbs, 34C. It definitely fit once zipped up, it had a nice tight look around the upper part of the dress above the yellow skirt part which I liked. But, like most halloween costumes, the zipper was a little flimsy so I need help to get the zipper up and it was somewhat difficult. Once on though, it fit nicely and there was some wiggle room. Overall, I was really pleased and it was exactly what I wanted, especially considering the low price!!

  My kids both wanted to be dinosaurs for Halloween this year.  The my 13 year old went with the T Rex, and the 10 1/2 year old chose this velociraptor, and the sizing is tough, because you have to be really short for the child's one to fit, and he was about 3"" too tall.  I figured being too tall would be worse than having it large, so even though he's only 4' 9"" or so, we went with the adult size.  He JUST BARELY can wear this without it just being too large.  He's a tiny kid, so it take a while to get the thing to inflate around him, and the motor has a bit of a problem keeping it adequately inflated so it is stiff enough to wear.  That being said, these type of suits are never going to be easy to move around in, that's kind of the point.  The issues my son has with it is 1) the zipper is in the back instead of the front like with the T Rex one.  This makes it very awkward to get into and zipped without assistance.  2) the T Rex has removable gloves, so you can wear them or not, and the velociraptor has its hands attached.  I was going to cut them off and sew elastic to the wrists to have it like the T Rex, but then we discovered that there is actually velcro at the wrists so you can pop your hands out.  This is nice except the reality is problematic because for starters, you have to close the velcro as tight as you can around your wrists to keep the air in, and the velcro is scratchy as all hell and hurts the wrists.  Not only that, but the velcro section is tight to even get a 10 year olds hands through, and putting them through is a scratchy experience too.  We cut the toes out of a couple of socks so he could put them on his wrists to cushion from the velcro, and those makeshift wrist guards should make it wearable, but it also has the added detriment of having floppy second pair of hands next to your hands when you put them through so you can actually use your hands.  So, I would recommend staying with the T Rex version.  It is just designed better.  Not only the above, but the velociraptor also has a longer head/nose.  So the nose is often dipped down more into the field of view, making it harder to see.  Granted, this might not be a problem if a full sized adult was wearing the adult costume, but I'm here giving my thoughts so there it is.  It's still pretty dang cool, and fun, so I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3.  Just buyer beware with this one.

  I was worried that the quality of this costumer might not be too great, but with the free return shipping I figured I would give it a go. When it came in I was very happy with the quality! It isn't see through, the wings stick to the costume very well with velcro. The velcro was a very nice touch so that I didn't have to wear the elastic that cuts into your arm pits. I wore this costumer for two events and the wings were taken on and off several times with no issue with the velcro. The leg warmers were perfect and stretchy if you have bigger calves. The headband was comfortable too. I wish they were bendy so they didn't stand up straight, but they were cute non the less!

  I know I'm posting this after Halloween but I still like to review things and there's always next year, or costume parties....or dress up time. I had intended for my newly turned 2 year old to be something else but he saw his big brother in a Catboy costume and got super excited. His brother suggested he be Gecko and he started jumping around shouting ""Gecko!"". So I bought him a second costume! He LOVED it from moment 1. We live in the North so it has to go over clothes for Trick or Treating. The fit was pretty spot on for him but he's not large for his age at all. If your child is a larger 2 year old you might want to size up. It's thin but the material makes it fairly warm still. The removable tail is a nice feature. We got SO many compliments on how cute our little guy looked in this though he kept tripping in it, I blame the mask. But he was having so much fun we didn't take it off. The CUTEST part of this costume with a little guy is the tail wiggling back and forth as they walk/run. I actually took a video of just him from behind and everyone thought it was the best Halloween video they'd seen bc it was super cute and different from actually seeing the kids faces, haha. I plan on letting my boys play with their costumes as long as they fit in them, should be perfect on snow days if we are inside.

  To start with, I'm not huge on dressing up for Halloween, but my roommates decided to throw a huge Halloween party so I kind of had to. I'm a huge fan of Top Gun, so I decided that I'd dress up as Maverick. I looked all over the internet for a costume, and stumbled upon this one. It seemed like a pretty good product, and I was correct. This costume is pretty awesome and feels really legit. I do like the interchangable name tags, so one person can be goose and the other Maverick.I'm about 5'10"" and 190lbs. It was a little tight around the back, so don't plan on doing any physical activities with it. It did get a little hot, but I live in North Carolina, so keep that in mind.

  This set fits well, with room for growth, my 43 inches tall son (4 year old).The jacket is very well made and the pretend saw, hammer and googles are nice, but the helmet has some design problem. It comes with a plastic ring that you are supposed to snap inside the helmet and should allow you to adjust the head circumference for different fittings, but it does not work.That thing neither snaps firmly into the helmet nor it stays closed in any position once you put it on. It is useless.Still, we purchased other role-play costume sets from other brands (as they had more parts) and none were well made as this.  I'd recommend.

  I love this costume! It's  the best money I have spent in many years. I am 6'4"", so it is a bit too small for me, I do fit., but the costume feet are just above  my ankles and I can only see through the top panel under the chin of the dinosaur. Regardless, I couldn't recommend it more highly. My 9 year old daughter (who is tall for her age) wore it, and it was just a tad too big for her, but it worked. She will fit perfectly next year. Bottom line is, it worked fine for both of us. It is simple to use and people loved seeing it walking around town. Don't hesitate. Buy this thing. It is hilarious.

  I bought this dress because a different dress I had gotten was falling apart. This one is perfect. She has been wearing it for the last month, and will continue doing so long after Halloween. I had to re-glue some of the gems back on the wand but for the price, its an amazing buy. Dress is made well. My daughter is 6 1/2. Average height and weight. I ordered a 7/8. About an inch too long but much better then being tight. It will last a while.

  My husband and I wanted to go as a couple so I thought this would be funny parked with him dressed as a banana!I am 5'7 and 130lbs. I ordered the Medium. It looked huge when I took it out of the bag but once on it fit like a glove. I am not very curvy but it hugs in all the right places. Even if I had a large bust it would be ok. I plan on wearing a yellow bra or lacy yellow bralette under it. The tail is kind of heavy but doesn't really bother me. The hoodie part is pretty big. You have to rest it on top of your head otherwise it covers your whole face. A few bobby pins can fix that though. It is a little bit longer than fingertip length but it doesn't look weird unless maybe you are shorter. It would be an easy fix though if you hemmed it.Overall for the money it was what I expected and is really cute. You can make it tame or even sexy which is perfect for the two parties I am going to in it. I also bought the socks this girl has on too. I haven't got them yet so not in the photo.

  This was a huge hit with my 3 year old for his birthday party. He wore it all day and every time we go on a walk in the 3 months since. He's not gentle, but this vest has held up well with no tears so far. The helmet doesn't fit him well.

  I love the shine of this dress, looks like a real princess gown!  Fit is as expected (2year old wearing mostly 3T) zips on over clothes easily.  It is a little bit long, but not so much that she trips on it, so fine for in the house.  I would take it up if we were going out in it.  Fully (lightly) lined so no seams to irritate delicate skin. The accessories are eh, but shiny- the wand and necklace survived the first day, and the crown, ring, and earrings broke almost immediately but haven’t been tossed yet because she puts the loose bits in bags and purses with other treasures to carry around.

  Halloween has always been my husband and my favorite holiday, but due to having a late August baby I was still HUGE when Halloween came around. Not only was this fairly slimming, but the red sashes are able to be wrapped different ways in different places and we customized the look a little. This costume held up to 3 nights of Halloween shenanigans and still looked great. The fabric is very stretchy, and after losing 51 pounds so far, I plan to wear this costume again this year.

  You see the pattern on the front in the picture? Fairly accurate. I like it. So why the back is completely solidly randomly pink is beyond me. I mean... c'mon how hard would it have been to make the print go all the way around.Kinda feels like cheating or something of a fake out. ""It's a Sally costume in front and random pink ugliness in back""It's like it's a Sally Costume as long as your pink back is to the wall but turn around and... who knows. Ugly pink cheap fabric.Also the blue turtle neckline  looks stupid. I just picked the stitches and took it off altogether. Pictures is my altered neckline.

Was still a tiny big snug in the waist area but overall really great costume. It is a dress and I wore fishnets under it. It did cover my butt. (I'm 5'7) It did get very warm even outside with the temp being about 65 degrees, it's made out of a fleece material from what I could tell. The ears are stuffed so they stay up very well.

  I ordered this for me and my fiance's Jaws costume idea. I ordered a Medium because some reviews said it runs small. I thought it was cute, however, the costume is not exactly like the picture shown. It is a lot longer then imagined. It actually went way down past my knees. because of that the dorsal fin sits right on my butt (which I have, so it makes it look even bigger) because of this, I kind of have to pull it up, and it makes it look really bunchy. It zips and unzips all the way down, which has more a hoodie feel then a dress. But overall, this isn't bad. I like the material, it's really soft and warm. For the price, it's pretty good.

  I think this is a nice, well-made costume.  I am happy with the price I paid.  But, as others have stated, this runs very small.  I pretty much always wear a size medium.  Because of reviews, I purchased an x-large.  I am planning to wear this while my husband is a fisherman, one child is a crab and the other a fish.  I ordered the largest size because I would rather it be loose than tight.  I can zip this up fine and it fits like I was hoping.  But, like I wrote, I am usually a size medium.  X-large with this costume is not x-large at all.  I wouldn't advise ordering this costume at all if you wear more than a medium size in normal clothing.  I am happy with this costume but am glad I read reviews and ordered up 2 sizes!The arms are long and loose on me (they look tighter on the model than they are on me).This zips completely open like a jacket which is different than what the current photo shows.I am 5'5"" and it hits me right at my knees, which I am happy with.  I wanted it to be longer on me than the model and figured she is much taller than me.  I am going for just the shark look, not the sexy shark look, haha.  The fin is on my butt.  The zipper in the front makes it look kind of bumpy but I don't mind it.  It just depends on what you are looking for.  If you want a fun, funny costume or one to wear with your kids, I think this is good.Oh, and according to the size chart I should have ordered a medium so I definitely would not pay attention to that.

  Bought this super last minute for Halloween as it was the only thing available in my daughter's size that would ship in time and I was pleasantly surprised how cute this costume actually is! My daughter got a lot of compliments on it! It was well-constructed and has some stretch to it so you could layer clothes underneath. The hat fit my daughter just right. I got her a 2T because she's small for her age (around 35"" tall and 27 lbs at nearly 3 years old) and it fit her PERFECTLY.

  Melissa and Doug makes high-quality and affordable costumes for preschoolers (~2.5 to 6 years).  This particular costume has been a favorite with my boys and their cousins too.  The jacket is easy to put on.  The hat is adjustable.  The siren actually sounds (it's annoying but the kids love it).  If you pair it with dark pants you have a Halloween costume.  We also used it for everyday dress-up.

  Immediate fun. People were beeping their car horns, adults were laughing, kids were running for their lives. Ok the kids were crying but that's life.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does get hot inside and the windows will fog up. I would make sure you're hydrated and not wear it over a long period of time especially in direct sunlight.  Someone left a review and said so life like. I don't know what their referencing because I've never seen a real life T. rex but it's definitely unique costume.

  The costume came exactly how I expected it besides the fact that the white part of the costume is green!  I even ordered white face paint apparently for no reason!  Other than that it's fine, it does run a little small in size and the wig that other reviews complained about was fine.  The wig is exactly how it looks in the picture and so is the costume besides the white being green.  The back of the costume is a sheer pink but not see thru by any means.  All in all for the price and for being for only 1 day its doable.

The only reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars is because after an hour somehow the yellow ribbon straps got ripped out but luckily I was able to thread it back in.I chose this one because it came with the cowgirl hat and bandana and thus was a cheaper and cuter outfit then buying another cowgirl one.

  I ordered this as both of my kids wanted to be bats for Halloween. Thought it’d be fun to be a bat with them too! I love the costume. It’s like wearing a warm fleece coat. I was happy I went with a Small. I am always an XS but tried the Small thinking it would be fine if a little big. It actually fit quite snug which was surprising but perfect for me! I would recommend ordering a size up. Very happy with the purchase!

  Item was not the sound one that I purchased even though the item says it is. I know I purchased without sound but onto the costume.If you are OVER 6ft tall, do not purchase the one size fit. You will have to bend forward and literally walk like a trex because of how uncomfortable it is to wear it. My item was clearly defective due to the so called ventilation/air pump fan was not working properly. All you could hear was a bad motor that wasn't working to do its basic function. I'm going on a limb here but the seller of this must've sold used costumes, which makes sense why it was only $32. I did my best to act like a half deflated trex for my daughter's birthday party but next time I'll spend the extra cash and buy one that not broken.

  I give this item 4 stars because it is actually a pretty good costume for the money. Two things to keep in mind... 1) It is definitely ""costume quality"". Don't buy this if you're headed to Munich and don't expect to use it over and over. 2) It runs big. I punched an extra hole in the suspenders to tighten it up a bit more than the factory adjustments allowed and still had to frequently slide the straps back over my shoulders. But for the price, it worked out fine. Our first Oktoberfest party was a success, so I imagine I'll invest in a better set for the future.

  The wig is the very disappointing part. Is looks like a Sally that is losing her hair, in clumps. The dress itself, was fantastic. The arms are great, but they do need a little assistance to stay in place (safety pin:).

  Okay if your trying to decide which Egyptian costume to choose from YOU FOUND THE PERFECT ONE. I just received mine in the mail and omg I’m so glad I decided to get it. Absolutely beautiful (and sexy as hell) the headpiece is also very good quality. So happy I listened to other reviews. I’m usually a large, but the under bodysuit stretches And it stretches perfectly around all the right areas. So I got a medium. (I’m 5’8, roughly around 180lbs) If your more on the conservative side then I suggest wearing A high Black thong/booty shorts, Your booty and female part is definitely out there (but covered).

  The company I got the costume from is awful. When I got the costume, it was missing the gloves. The company wouldn't let me return it. If it wasn't for that, it would be okay. The costume itself isn't too bad. The dress looks good, but the wig is horrible. The wig has a lot of bald spots on it and it was hardly worth using. I would definitely recommend buying a different red wig. I actually ended up finding a better Sally costume than this, but this one still looks good. Buy it if you want, but don't spend too much money on it. It looks cheap.

  When I saw this costume on Amazon, I just knew that I had to have it for Halloween even though it was only May. Over the years, I have a hard time finding costumes that I like and this one just hit the mark. It is creative and fun not just for the wearer, but for others too. So far, my family has gotten a good laugh and gives the wearer an opportunity to have fun acting out quick alien abduction scenes. I can't wait until Halloween to entertain party-goers and trick or treaters. I'm 5'11"" and 180 lbs and it fits well. One more thing, I like the fact that it is open-faced for the wearer. It gives me an opportunity to wear a creative costume yet eliminated the need to use a mask or makeup. So it is a clean and comfortable walk away at the end of the night. Also, the open face does not inhibit eating or drinking at the party which has always been a negative in wearing a mask. It came packaged new and just like an item you would buy at a big box Halloween store.

  If you are taller than 5' 9"" expect to hunch wearing this, there is a metal support wire that is in between the throat window and the lower head window that will be right at (or almost up) your nose, using the upper window puts it right up against your face (which gives you about 10 min of visibility before your breath fogs it up) hunching and using the lower window is fine, but your back will punish you the next day.It's a great costume however even with the 'I'm stuck in a plastic bubble of heat', I had people stop and take pictures of me when I walked my kid to the bus on Halloween (our communist school doesn't allow costumes for kids, go figure), and it fills up quickly and lasts a long time on the AA's, but height is a real problem, as this is very much designed for the lower side of adult height (god help you if you're above 6').

  Inexpensive wigs generally don't look like the pictures, at least without a lot of manipulation before wearing. That isn't the case here; looks like the picture right out of the box. This feels higher quality and looks more realistic than most wigs in this price range. Other wigs are thin and ratty in the back, but this one was very full and a perfect length. Reasonable quality construction, didn't lose a lot of strands, held its form, and stayed in place all night.I like it wery much.

  I bought this for my 6 year old grandson in a size Medium. He is tall for his age (size 8 clothes). There's a little bit of extra length on the legs that is easily able to be clipped up with bobby pins. The added length is great since he'll be able to wear it all year! He loves to dress up as characters. Perfect costume and fit. Very well made.

  We bought it big so sizing of vest and hard hat was a little large (girls just turned 2yrs and are very average size-middle percentile for age) like we expected but safety glasses were tight and wouldn't stay closed(velcro).

  Giving two stars because it was so cheap I should have known it wouldn't be great... First of all, the headband came broken (one antenna was completely detached from the band with no good way to fix it), and second of all it is wildly unflattering. The model looked cute in it, but it really just fits like a huge trash bag with holes in it for your arms and head. You definitely are getting what you pay for with this. It is not the worst thing ever, it just isn't great. I could forgive it a bit if the headband wasn't broken.

  The costume is really cute in person! However, as I was unsure about the fit I ordered a medium when I usually wear a small. I’m 5’2, 36B, with an athletic hour-glass shape. I have wide hips and a bigger derrière. The medium was perfect on top except for the sleeves being a bit long, But the waist and lower area were baggy on me and didn’t look right. The belt fit ok but the garter was WAY too big, even on my muscular legs. So I exchanged for a small. Hope this helps :)

  The product was perfect for the Halloween party I went to. It fit well, there are three pieces. The first one is a bodysuit that is sheer gold. You can flip it inside out and make it all black. The second piece fits a little higher. I thought it would be more on my hips, but it is more around the wait which means you show a lot of leg on the side. This was fine, i just could not wear anything underneath the body suit. Third piece was the headress, I have to say I bought my own one of these and ended up with the one from the costume. It kept my wig in place better and made it not as fluffy. Will definitely wear it again.

  The costume fit me well.  I looked at the recommended size from the company based off of my measurements, and it was perfect.  I only gave it three stars because as some previous reviewers have stated, you'll really need to sew the leg wraps if you'd like them to stay up all night.  I wore it the day before Halloween and they kept falling down, no matter how tight I tied them.  Same for the arm wraps.  Glad I took it for a test run.  Also, note that the front is extremely low.  I sewed mine up a bit in the front and it was perfect for me.

  I love this hoodie. After spending nearly $200 on a costume for Halloween, I saw this advertised on Amazon and just had to have it. It is so decently priced, I returned my other costume and bought this one instead and I am so glad I did!! Saved me a bunch and is even more cute than my previous costume!I am 5'5.5"" and 135 - 137 pounds; kind of a busty hour glass shape. This large hoodie fits me *perfectly*, just a little snug with a bit of space for wearing a sweater dress or something underneath. I could probably had bought a medium if I didn't want to layer under the hoodie. The length reaches just at a point that if I bend over it doesn't show my bum but I still will probably want to wear opaque leggings or short shorts under this just in case. My only wish would be to make the sleeves just a bit longer, but that is more personal preference because I have longer arms.The hoodie itself is better than the photo examples on Amazon. If you look up ""leg avenue bat costume"" on Google you will see that the hoodie's zipper actually goes all the way down and can open fully. It also is full fleece material, so it's insanely soft and warm. The hood is big, and looks great both up or down. The wings are super thick, not flimsy or cheap looking. Keep in mind this hoodie is very, very warm. It will be much too warm for anyone who gets hot easily, but perfect or someone who is worried about freezing outside on Halloween.This whole costume has a casual feel to it because of the cut and material, so this would be great for a casual Halloween party, for a teen who is trick or treating, or just someone who loves looking like a bat (judgement free zone here)!I posted this comment before Halloween so if someone is on the fence on buying this hoodie, i wanted to help that make the right choice. Go with this hoodie! It's awesome. I plan on posting reference photos post Halloween.

  Quality costume. Its advisable to wear an undershirt though, its not the softest of fabric. I purchased this along with ""Room on the Broom"" (a children's witch book) , to hype up my little one even more, worked like a charm. It is true, not that I didn't believe you Amazon community, but the dress falls flat. I'm sure a little tulle can fix that right up though. My child wears a size T4 and I purchased 3-4, it fits wonderfully for now but I foresee it not lasting, I should have gone with a size 5. Anywho, I recommend it.

  I absolutely love this costume! Cannot wait to wear it for Fantasy Fest this year. However I rated this 4 stars because my package was missing 4 items (arm cuffs, headpiece and necklace.) I have contacted the seller to send me the missing items.UPDATE to 5 Stars: Seller responded quickly and assured me the replacement items would be sent. I received the package and not only did I receive the missing items... I received the whole costume again! Now I own two which is actually perfect for my roommate to wear. Thanks Dreamgirl... or shall I say Dreamguy? ;)Now for the costume: I'm really only wearing the skirt, headpiece and cape. I like the costume better without the shirt so I won't be wearing it. The arm cuffs are too big (expected this, I have small wrists) so I ordered gold metal bracelets to replace. The necklace is very cheap, basically just a triangle of fabric glued to a string. I ordered a real metal necklace with the eye or horus to really make it stand out. Lastly I ordered similar gold gladiator sandals to complete the look! All in all I really like this costume and the fabric is really soft. Price could be cheaper, but all costumes are expensive.

  I ordered a size small toystory jessie costume from amazon.com through costumes4less on wednesday morning the 26th, When purchasing this product in the buy section I made sure to purchase this product with a 1 to 3 day shipping to make sure that it was there by saturday the 29th the latest.  My son really wanted me to dress up with him this year, and i was increadably excited to be Jessie with my little man being Buzz Lightyear.  After purchasing this product I went to check the status later that night after getting off work around 2am to find that the guarenteed delivery by the 28th had changed to anywhere between the 28th and november 2nd, I was then very disapointed in this company, no one wants to recieve thier halloween costume the day after halloween, expecially when they paid the extra money to recieve this costume in time.  I periodically checked the tracking on this product to find that it was in NC from 3am to 11pm without moving then the same thing the next day in SC then in GA for a whole day also, in my life I have never recieved such bad customer service, for when i called costumes for less they said it was only an ordering answereing service but i could call back on monday (HALLOWEEN DAY) to speak to someone who could handle my call.  Had I known that this would be the way everything would be handled, I would NEVER of purchased this item.  I probley would of accepted it had it arrived on halloween so I could go trick or treating with my little one in costume, but it arrived on November 1st around 1pm which i quickly told the ups guy that I am refusing this product that had a 1 to 3 day shipping almost a week ago, I am expecting a full refund including the shipping cost since I paid extra and WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM COSTUMES4LESS AGAIN.

  It was a great costume. The only bummer is we thought it came stuffed but it didn’t, so we just used the airbags from other packing boxes to fill it. That worked great because it didn’t make it too hot and it was just enough to fill it in the right way. It was a little loose around the waist once we stuffed it, it kind of made it sag on him a little but it didn’t fall so it was okay. The head is the only part that stuffed. And of course there were the inappropriate jokes about where the nose is. Ha ha.

My three year likes to pretend to be a doctor herself.  I love Melissa and Doug products because I believe and trust they have control over production and quality.  I am so afraid of toys containing lead paint or anything else harmful.  I believe in quality and not quantity.  I always loved traditional toys and I stay away from fads. I did my research on Melissa and Doug and feel good about buying their products.  My little one loves to wear the doctor's lab coat and make sure everyone is healthy in the house.  I really didn't pay to much mind to Melissa and Doug products until my last baby was born I went back to check why I didn't purchase Melissa and Doug for my first two..only to realize the company started when my first daughter was born.

The costume was also very soft and fuzzy and I didn't have to worry too much about layering a ton of clothes underneath because the costume was warm. I HIGHLY recommend this costume and am so pleased this is the one I chose for my 2 year old's first trick or treating experience!

  my husband has wanted one of these costumes for years. finally they halved in price and I scooped one up for a surprise. he has worn it at least once a week since. after seeing it, one of his friends ordered one and now they do t-rex things together: go to the bar, the bowling alley. he took it dancing at a club, it was a huge hit for the 30 min he was able to wear it before he almost literally melted. it IS hot inside. you will be drenched in sweat if the temp is above 40. and even if it's not.. the suit will still be warm inside and the water will condense in the head of the dinosaur and occasionally rain on you. the windows fog up. still worth it.my 8 yr old has worn it to dance in our driveway for his brother's schoolbus, and to amuse people in our subdivision as they drive to work. you can see them cracking up in their cars, it's hilarious. when son wears it, the haunches pretty much rest on the ground and he can just see out the bottom of the chest window. husband is 6', wide shouldered and 240#. I knew we would be pushing the limits of the suit but it does fit. his shoulders are up inside the neck a bit which makes for a really tight fit. and the legs end a little lower than mid-calf, but the feet flopping down help hide that.they've been posting t-rex exploits on facebook and everyone I run into comments on how much they like it. I thought these were pretty popular costumes, but I'm surprised how many people have never seen them.  my boss even got one after seeing the videos- for Halloween he stood still in his yard and pretended to be a blow up lawn decoration, then scared the crap out of people when they got near him. he's 5'9 and slight runner's build, it fits him perfectly.ONE CON: the seam above the zipper has let loose twice on our suit. I had seen this in the reviews. the first time I stitched it up and it ripped out again. the second time I stitched it up and also stitched the top of the zipper together (above the teeth, so it doesn't affect the working of the zipper at all). sewing thru the thicker material there holds everything together much better and that seam hasn't split since.

  This was a fun costume for the theme party. I'm 5'3. 108lbs. I purchased the small. I bought the net stockings separate. The only thing that was to big on me was the garter for my leg. The garter is attached to the belt so I couldn't just not wear it. Maybe it can be a holster for something but I wore it as a garter. I used a very small safety pin to make it smaller.  Good thing I had that safety pin. It was a little cheeky in the back side but the net stockings helped cover up a little. Had to basically undress to use the ladies room.  The only downside to the costume.

Age 8, but she can get away with wearing a size 6 or size 8. We got a large so it fits well and she should have a good length of time that she can wear it. I shall be interested in finding out what happens if it gets put into the washing machine. For now though, its pretty soft and she feels all nice and cozy in it.

  We purchased this costume for our 2 year old to go trick or treating in. She loved it! It has a little kitten on the apron and the hat is very comfortable for her (it's soft all over). It was cold so she wore it with black leggings and a black turtleneck. Everyone thought she looked adorable (which she did!). The only thing that I would complain about is that the skirt looks very full in the picture. It didn't look nearly this poofy once she had it on. You'd need some sort of an underskirt to get the effect in the photo. But it was still really cute and she loved it... she still has to wear the hat every once in a while!

  Not like a Halloween costume, much better material and better stitches. I purchased for a preK class and because of the elastic wrists and ankles it fits my teenest to the largest kiddos. Helmet is ok, had to take off the size adjuster to make it easier to share. I added some Moble 1 stickers and Corvette racing vinyls to dress it up. I found a racing shop to lend me a real cool steering wheel but the one it comes with is ok and a light weight foam.

  My four-year-old daughter loves to play pretend, and we're hard-pressed to find more realistic-yet-kid-friendly dress-up outfits than those from Melissa & Doug.  The four-year-old loves the bright colors and the imaginative play that springs forth when she's using the costume, and I love the quality and that these dress-up costumes provide a dress-up alternative to the Princess.  Not that there isn't a place for princesses in the World of Pretend, but sometimes a gal just has to put on her firesuit and take her Amazon Box Racecar for a spin around the track!This set comes with a racing suit, a cool helmet with a visor, and a foam racecar steering wheel.If only it came in Big People sizes, too!

  My son loves this police officer costume set.  He's 4, and his father is training to become a police officer.  This role play set allows him to mimic his dad, which he of course loves to do.  My only warning is to be careful of the whistle - it falls out of the elastic band meant to hold it very easily.  I'd suggest putting it in one of the clear pockets, or else tying a string to it so it doesn't get lost (as ours did, in the middle of Best Buy.  Good thing we found it!).  The walkie talkie does make sounds, but it's one repetitive clip that can get old very fast - so it wouldn't hurt to keep the batteries out if that sort of thing bugs you.  Overall a great set that my son wants to wear everywhere!This set fits my son perfectly - at 4, he's about 44"" tall and 45 lbs.

  I ordered this for Halloween. It fits fantastically, and it is very detailed and fun. I didn't order the leggings or boots to go with it, but used my own, so it is both a little warmer and a little cheaper. Just add a sword and some eyeliner and you're good to sail the seven seas. One thing I'd like to point out is that it did take some effort to figure out how the belt goes on, but I eventually found the Velcro. Great costume.

  It is a really nice costume! I'm 5'6"" 140 lbs. My cup is a DDD. I ordered the Small Medium. The chest area is snug, but it doesn't hug my waist quite how I wanted it to. It's a little roomy. However, I have troubles with fits everywhere I go because of my curvy figure. It's a beautiful costume, and I am so excited to wear it! I usually wear a medium in adult clothing, but the small medium was a little big on me. If I were to order the X-Small, it probably would be too small on my chest, but just perfect for my waist. It's a gamble, but when in doubt go 1 size smaller than you think would fit you. Probably not 2 sizes small, and DEFINITELY not a size bigger than normal. Length for me was just like in the picture.

  Wow! Can you imagine one of these police ladies coming towards you? Maybe if she pulled you over, it may make for a fun night! YEAH RIGHT- Buddy, that's only on the internet.This is a horrific female stereotype. Police officers are here to serve and protect. They risk their lives on duty every day for the general public. No police officer would show that much skin. Need to do a high case on foot? Gurl - not in them heels you're not. You know what else is sexy? Getting handcuffed! Getting arrested! So much fun! We should sexualize this for the fun of a holiday that was never meant to be sexy, or any other time. If you're on duty, what if you get shot? I am telling you sister (or brotha', if you're into that), that push up bra is nothing like a bullet-proof-vest. Police batons? They were outlawed many years ago for a reason. Glasses inside? because it's sexy - Im sure that will make it easy to see when you need to serve and protect the people and not your sterotypes.Stop the stereotypes, stop the sexulization of respectful people.

  The police officer costume was requested by the family, along with a couple of other costumes for their 3-year-old son. It arrived at my home in a sturdy clear bag which is perfect for keeping all the pieces together and great for storage. The costume is well designed for the kind of play that children do, from the pockets for everything, including handcuffs, to the solid construction and fabric. It was a big hit!

  I am 5'2 with a 34DD bust and I normally wear a medium. But after reading reviews I decided to go up a size and I'm so glad I did b/c it fits perfectly!I love this costume! The quality of the materials  from the dress to the badges are awesome, despite most Halloween costumes being flimsy and cheap.-The Dress is form fitting but does not over-do it with tightness. It's sexy, but not overly short so that if you bend over you see everything.-The Belt is a perfect touch to this outfit, but I just wish it had more holes so I could have made it tighter to fit better.-The Hat was just right for my head, but I found it a little bulky.All in all, you'll definitely get the bang for your buck!

If it were tight I think it may be hard to get on and off since there’s no zipper, but the arms and chest material are a bit stretchy so that would help.

  This set is very well made of high quality fabric with and child tough stitching.  The velcro fasteners make it easy to put on and take off.  Although the tools are plastic, they are still functional.  The walkie talkie requires a battery in order to work.  It lights up, and says something unintelligible and has a siren sound.  Might be better suited for a police role play suit than a train engineer.  The name tag and train schedule are plastic coated and appear to be for dry erase markers.My five year old grandson thought it was great and he wore it when we took him on his first real train ride.  I would recommend the Melissa and Doug role playing outfits to parents and grandparents as they feed a young child's imagination and serve to open up numerous educational opportunities to involve children in something besides video games or TV.

  Received the product and when I opened it I noticed it was in a return bag, meaning someone else bought this exact one and returned it. Guess I know why, the zipper is completely broken! What the hell?! You can see where someone tried to get it back on the track because there are frayed pieces of thread and the zipper is stretched out so it wouldn’t even fit on there anyway. Do you not check your returned items when they are shipped back or do you just repackage them and get them back into your inventory?! This product will not work unless you can zip it up!

  Bought this costume for my next Disney Cruise. Tights are a little see-through, but not too bad. I will be wearing black leggings instead due to it not covering my backside the way I would like. I didn't like the frilly lace, so I cut them off. The shoulder belt thing looks like crap on me (I'm 5'5""), so I'm still debating on whether or not to wear it. It's still a cute outfit. I did have to throw the top in the dryer to get the wrinkles out, but that's only because I don't own an iron.

  Overall this is a great toy for a great price.Here is why I think it's great:1.The outfit is made out of very durable material.2.Pockets are made of see though plastic which so when the tools are inside you can see them - a nice feature.3.Includes all the essential toys/parts to play doctor.4. Parts are made from durable plastic5. Pasrts are large enough not to be a major concern that a toddler could swallow it. Exept for ear pieces on the stetoscope.Improvements I would suggest:1. Stetoscope did not include batteries. I know I could order online but would have been nice if they were included.2. Thermometer should be more realistic - you have to press it again a surface and it clicks aka measures temperature. Seems to be fascinating to toddlers so this comment is more for adults.

  It’s super soft and stretchy! The hood is absolutely adorable! Definitely keeps you warm in the chilly fall evenings! I ordered a 2x and I’m a rather curvy size 18/20 so it fit snug but was very flattering.

  Ordered the president piggy backSize was fine- I am 5'2"" and had to pin up the bottom of his jacket so you could see his legs and also had to pin up some of the inside or else the crotch of the pants was so low I couldn't walk. I wish there was at least 2 height options on these.Complaint: the head is made of rubber and is so heavy it droops down. I had to keep pulling it up so people could tell who it was ( myou can see in pictures). If the head had been placed better or made of fabric it would have stayed looking upright much better.All this said- it was a really funny costume and I loved it. Would I order again?

  Ordered it for my 3 yr old for Halloween 2010. He's of average height and weight so this fit perfectly. Unless there's a growth spurt, seems like he'll get to use it for another 1-2 years. It's a well made product, as good as the real thing and way better than the cheap vinyl outfits you see in discount stores. The yellow reflective tape shines bright. I especially like the helmet since it is very sturdy (a kid could stand on it without denting it) and has straps inside that snap together to fit around the head so air can get under there and they don't sweat. The bullhorn and extinguisher attach to the jacket with velcro wraps. It's useless tying it on since they make the outfit bulky. Haven't put batteries in the bullhorn, just to save our sanity! I'm sure it works. Your kid will sleep with this at night if you let them!!

  I have purchased many Melissa and Doug items and this is the first one that seriously disappoints. As other reviews say the helmet non-adjust is ridiculous, the fire extinguisher is simply plastic with no water holding feature, and I guess my bad I did not realize the bullhorn requires batteries so not knowing that the horn was a bust too. the coat is ok but certainly not the quality of another brand I had purchased for another grandchild 6 years ago.....would have purchased that brand again but the item was shipped to a child in another state and I could not recall name.

  Awesome costume.  The overdress is extremely long.  I'm 5'10"" and it was dragging the floor.  The costume is super comfortable.  The gold bodysuit is completely sheer and made of gold lame' fishnet material.  I bought the 1X/2X since I have large hips but I  had plenty of room in it.  I wear a 14W in some clothes and a 16W in others, depending on the style.  I could have gotten a smaller size but prefer the coverage of the 1X/2X.

  Cute costume and very comfortable, is a bit big though. Overall I'm happy with the purchase. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I dont like that the larger size costume skirt is different than the smaller sizes, and I liked the smaller sizes skirt better. I dont like that they make this change when you order the larger size.

  Do buy. You will not be disappointed. This was exactly what I was looking for. She matched her twin who dressed as Mickey for a Disney trip. She doesn’t do well keeping head bands on so Purchased Minnie hairtie ears. But the whole outfit is of great quality I’ve already washed and hung to dry and still looks great. I was a little worried about it being a bodysuit as other reviewers noted is hard for changes. We are potty training so I was going to cut it out and decided not to. I figured it would stay down better with it since after we got it I realized there was a good lift on the tutu part. And honestly it wasn’t that difficult to pull al the way down the few potty trips we made it has a good stretch to it.

  When our Dinosaur costumes arrived (we purchased T-Rex & the Gray Velociraptor), we had to try them on immediately. Since family was visiting, everybody wanted in on the fun. We range is height from 5""5"" to 6'0"" & they fit all of us. The air blower takes 4 AA Batteries & works very well, filling the suit faster than you'd think it would for the size of the blower. Since the purchase, these costumes have provided hours of fun:1. surprising the grandchildren at their house2. ""pole dancing"" dino party (we have videos-hahahahaha)3. parties4. BBQs5. Waving to cars as they drive by has been a blast6. Kids really get a kick out of seeing these dinosaursEverywhere we've taken them people want to try them on & what a great time we've had with them.

  Negative side: Got this for my kid, and first time she tried it on (carefully), the plastic low quality .01cent zipper broke within seconds. I know this zipper because I manufacture products with a zipper and these are really weak. With just a day before Halloween, I had to break out the sewing machine and replace the zipper to keep from spoiling the fun.Our friends daughter who got the same suit dropped the battery pack inside the suit and the wire ripped out. solder gun required to fix on the fly.For usability It turns into a sweatbox and the gloves get really hot even on a night that was about 35F.Positive side:The fan battery last a long time and the suit was a hit.Kids had a blast.The look is great.In summary, if the zipper was a bump up in quality I would have given this 5 solid stars even with the sweat.

  The top was huge. Straps continuously were falling off. I'm normally a size small or 2-6, I'm 5'5 and 135 lbs. The pants fit great-but the zipper legit BROKE within an hour of wearing it. I wasn't even sitting, the pants were not tight, it simply was made super cheap and the zipper part just broke. The top stayed zipped with the actual zipper ripped open.

  My 4 year old niece loves all things Barbie pink and princess so I wasn't sure how this gift would go over at her birthday party. Much to my surprise, upon opening the gift (and with many more waiting to be opened) she clapped with delight and immediately asked me to help her put it on.

  The costume does not have any zippers or buttons, so the only way in (and out) is through the top.  If you're planning to drink much with the costume, keep this in mind as it was very inconvenient to remove just to use the restroom.  Material is Lycra-spandex type, so the fit was perfectly form fitting.  Only drawback, the start of the wraps are sewn into the costume so you can tie it around your body.  However, even tying it around, because of the material of the costume, it was constantly sliding down and loosening.  I had to safety pin the wraps at the knot to keep them from slipping, which eventually caused holes in the costume by the end of the night.  Overall, I loved the look and got many compliments.

  I'm 5'4"" about 170, I ordered the XL thinking it wouldn't  be to snug but fit and that it would maybe be a little short. It was the opposite. It was skin tight but a good length. The material feels nice, not to thick or thin and very soft, overall a good quality. The general construction of the costume is wonderful, I was impressed but it's too tight for my comfort level. I wish it fit because it's adorable but it doesn't so if I can't pawn it off on a friend it will be going back :(

  Overall, the costume was a hit! We decided not to wear the neck bowties, but we still got a lot of compliments on the outfits. From what I can tell  sizes Small-XL are a 5 pc costume, the dress is separate from the jacket. Plus sizes are only 4 pcs, the dress and jacket are one piece. I'm on the right. I personally liked the way the XL fit, and the costume seems to be very flattering on curvy women. The plus size 1x/2x seemed quite roomy on me, and I didn't like that there was so much extra material.

  My twin toddlers have been playing with this set (the hat and vest, not the other accessories as they have a little brother who could get hurt) for over 6 months and the set has been washed repeatedly with o ill effects.  The hat is quite small, even with the elastic back so ours has been altered with additional elastic as my boys heads are large for their age (adult hats and helmets).  If your child is tiny, the apron may have to be pinned up in some way to keep it from falling off their shoulders.

  I love the consistency in Melissa and Doug toys. Its hard to buy things online but when I see a company like this I just know that I will be happy with the product and they did not let me down this time.I bought this as a halloween costume for my son (who is three), which he wore this year and loved. But it also is now in his toy bin and when he is feeling heroic he will put it on.The things that I love about it:-although a tad big it fits my son fine at the age of three, but also can be worn for the next few years.-the helmet is adjustable on the inside to fit a ranges of head sizes- The personalized name tag is a cute addition and very fun and unique-it comes exactly as it looks like and the quality is great and sturdy- reflective tape made halloween fun and safe which was a really awesome feature to have-the mega horn makes noise and comes with batteries.Things I would change:- the megaphone and the fire extinguisher were a bit heavy on the velcro belt hooks and dangle, it made it impossible for my son to comfortably walk around with them all night and so they were abandoned before we left for the night-the fire extinguisher is non functional what so ever and is just plasticthis will be easy for me to resell in a heart beat and I am fine with the price with what I got. I already had the fire boots so it was easy to put warm clothing and black sweat pants and my son was looking great this year! anything that inspires imagination is perfect in my book!

  I was very excited to get this costume. WARNING TO BUYERS: The entire back of the costume is solid pink, and not even a pink that matches the front. Very disappointed in that. I like the fact that it came with the wig and gloves, although I won't be using the gloves. The wig is made of bright red yarn sewn onto a piece of red material for the cap. Please be aware the amount of yarn on this wig is so sparse that you see the wig cap all over. I will be adding more yarn to cover that problem so for me it's not a huge issue, just a inconvenience. But if you are not able to spend the time doing so I would recommend getting a regular wig instead. I have made in the past a complete yarn wig (cap included) for my Rainbow Brite cosplay so this is not new for me. If you are going to add to this wig, please keep in mind, it is very time consuming. This is not something to do last minute. I just wish I would've known that the back of the dress was solid, I would have ordered the largest size and altered it to fit and the back would be covered using the extra material. Disguise Costumes, I recommend adding a back view of your items, as the front view alone is very misleading.

  It's beautiful but the fit is awkward! I bought it for costume night on a Disney cruise. I had to steam the severe creases before we left home and then repack it to wear on the cruise. The top is saggy and for lots of chest! IT's very low cut. I wore a white tank under and it worked fine. the waist isn't really proportioned well to the chest--the waist is snug. I usually wear a medium and it worked fine--but was snug. The fabric is wonderful and it feels so elegant when wearing! The puffed sleeves are a tad bit itchy wear they hit your arm, but not too bad for a few hours. I'm 5'7"" and it was at least 8 inches too long for me! I cut and hemmed it before we left on the cruise so I wouldn't step on it all day. It's a really great quality costume for the price. I've read other reviews that complained about the neckline too I wish they'd change it! It comes with the blue headband and black ribbon for the neck.

  Costume is very thin, but you get what you pay for. It states that the bow tie and ascot are detachable, but they are not. I would rather not have the neck piece so I can use makeup for the face/neck/arms. The back is completely see through and not patterned like the front. Buy some more red yarn and add to the wig.

  This is a really adorable, really practical costume.  I was turned off by the photo with the sexy tights and boots, but the costume itself is basically a hoodie with wings and ears.  My daughter loved it, and it's perfect for cold Halloweens because she could wear it over warmer layers.  With just leggings, you've got a full costume.  It is completely black and I kept losing my kid in the dark, so I ended up putting glo bracelets on her ankles to fund her.  It runs small - the large fit a 6-year old that normally wears a size 5/6.  The only downside is that the zipper isn't great quality and kept sticking.  And it's an original costume - we didn't run into any other bats at multiple Halloween events.

  I bought this for my 10 year old son for his Halloween costume and this was hands down, my greatest (sober) Amazon purchase of all time. He's just shy of the 5 ft mark but it fit him perfectly, with plenty of room to grow. I even wore it to my job (a bank) on Halloween as the office dressed up, and we had clients, coworkers, and even our HR department in hysterics. The only real negatives I noticed (and these are all fairly minor) about this costume is that the battery pack requires a tiny screwdriver (I brought one to work lol), the ventilation in the costume is non-existent (yes, I know it has to be to keep it inflated), and that the batteries die fairly quickly; though I'm sure that could be debatable based on the battery brand used.Now my son and his best friend decided that they were going to terrorize the neighborhood as dinosaurs and his friend got the kids costume (where your face is exposed in the neck of the suit). His friend kept his on ALL night as the ventilation was perfect, but my son would constantly unzip his and walk with his face out - thus ruining the full effect. They ran around for HOURS and we did not notice any wear-and-tear on the tails from the asphalt or rough grounds. They hands down took the neighborhood's 'popular vote' in best costume and had many adults in literal tears as they watched them run up their driveways.This costume is definitely a humorous investment and has been worn numerous times since Halloween. Our dogs hate it, my cat is totally sketched out by it, and my son thinks it's the greatest thing since the X-box One came out.(Also, here's a video of the boys as they approach one house - you can hear the adults losing their minds over the costumes :)[...]

  This costume looks great, but I’m confused by the sizing, and the size chart didn’t help. The reviews are confusing as well, probably because people aren’t mentioning what size they ordered.I’m a 5’6” woman, and I wear a size 12. I ordered the “Standard” option, and my costume said “one size” on the package insert. However, it was much too short in both the legs. It was plenty roomy enough in the body, but the feet were up at my upper shins. It was super short in the arms as well, but I think that’s how it’s supposed to be worn, with much of your arms up inside the body of the suit and very little sticking out, since a T-Rex has such short arms.Really weird how short in was in the legs.Super cute though. I’d love it if it was long enough.

  This costume is awesome! Fits well: the sizing is pretty accurate, as I had read in other reviews. I love it because you can go with or without leggings or tights, or wear it with skinny jeans and boots, making the look a little more versatile for those who maybe don't want to bare as much leg. Can't wait to wear it for Halloween this year!

  Reminds me of my first sewing project in H.S. Home Ec ... I'm an adult. 5'5"", avg wt.,T-Rex feet stopped mid-shin; arms came only halfway too; the shoulders were so narrow I couldn't zip much past my waist & only if I hunched over. There's extra material, but I'm guessing that accommodates inflation. Basically, it's sewn all wrong. Read thru reviews - some people happy, others in the same boat I am, disappointed and returning. Amazon needs to exert MUCH better quality control before wasting everyone's time & money, including their own with defective returns. I'd still reorder if I knew a different vendor who took care to manufacture a decent, sellable product and one FAMILIAR with ADULT U.S. sizing made it. But how in the world would I know that? This one, however, is TRASH! Ruined my Christmas surprise.

  I sent this to my youngest grandson for his birthday because a fireman's hat that I had given the older one at Christmas had been the source for many arguments about whose turn it was to wear it.  So the youngest got this set and then the arguments continued because the hat to this suit plus the suit itself became the source now for many showdowns. So to solve all the problems I got the older grandson the same outfit so they can be a team of firemen and now problem solved and one more too...my daughter will be using these for Halloween costumes at the end of the month!  A hit indeed for all involved and Granna is the hero!

  We purchased this costume based of off its reviews, and we were not disappointed. We wanted to avoid a costume that would fall apart or not match the pictures. The last thing I want to do is have to try to fix something that I spent money on. This costume arrived quickly, and matches the picture. The black material is warm, and the seams are nicely stitched (i.e. won't come apart). The hat is the perfect size for a toddler, without obstructing vision. The sleeves are a tiny bit long for our two year olds, but it still looks nice, and I don't see it being much of a problem because the sleeves are artistically shredded at the ends for effect. The dress goes down to my daughters' feet (one is 38 inches tall and the other is 36) but they should be fine with shoes on. This dress is made well enough to wear more than once (for parades and Halloween) and we will probably keep it out for dress up for the next year or so. If you have twins, and want to coordinate, there is another one in purple...

  The model made me feel confident I would not be too busty for this but it showed a lot more cleavage. Having the lace in the front meant getting and awkward crotch bunch in order to cover up my chest. If I was a better seamstress this could've been easily fixed. The white lace is the itchiest thing you have ever encountered and can't be removed without ripping the seams. Would only recommend as a base piece for someone who is crafty. If you want a costume that can be worn out of the bag I would not recommend.

  My 3 year old son likes wearing this and it fits him well. The tools, pockets, etc really go the extra mile to make this something that will get played with. Everything is sewn to the overall and you need to cut the threads to separate it, this was ok with the tools, but the hat a few stitches that were very tight and I was afraid I was going to cut the hat while trying to cut the stitches, it seemed like overkill and unnecessary. I was surprised to find the little radio actually works (not as a radio, just makes a train sound), it requires a 9v battery, not included, and after hearing how LOUD this is, I wished I had just left the battery out for pretend play. Its a very loud train whistle and bell and even my son covered his ears and said it was so loud. Overall, very cute though.

  I was absolutely pleased with this outfit when I got it. Unlike a lot of these costumes, this one is longer (hits at my lower thigh and I have LONG legs) and is made of quality material. In other words, you don't look like you just stepped out of a porno (definitely a good thing if you ask me). The dress fits very nicely. I am 5'8"", 150 lbs, 36C and I ordered the XL. It fits perfectly and is comfortable. If you like the skin-tight look, don't order a size up. If you want to be comfortable, do.No cuffs, shades, or baton included, just FYI. Dress, belt, hat, two metal badges, and name plate all included.Honestly I almost wish the dress didn't have the police emblems on it...I'd wear it as a ""little black dress"" if it didn't! It just has a very, very flattering fit--especially for curvy girls!Very pleased over all and looking forward to sporting it!

  The safety googles (which are not adjustable) are so tight that they make marks on my 3 year olds face. The hat is so large that it falls off. The piece in the inside the hat that is supposed to be adjustable pops open and won't stay latched so you can't adjust it to make it smaller. Pretty upsetting for a set that cost this much when your 3 year old can't even wear all the pieces.
