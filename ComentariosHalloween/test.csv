  We've now bought 3 so far, one as a gift for my 3 year old daughter, and two others as birthday gifts for other toddlers.  All the other kids wanted to put on the lab coat and play doctor, and the birthday boy was happy too.  I wish the batteries were included but when I but them as gifts, I open the stethoscope and put in the two AAA batteries so the gift is all ready to go as soon as the gift wrapping comes off :)

  Well made jacket in a nice thick material.  Furry trim is a really nice detail.  The ears are not as perky as photoed but otherwise my daughter really like it and wants to wear it as a regular jacket.  It should be durable to pass down - not one of those disposable costumes which I appreciate.

  I took a chance and got the adult size of this costume for my 5 foot-tall 12 year-old.  It was a good call as it fits very well other than the legs getting bunched up at his ankles‚Ä¶  But that‚Äôs easily solved.  The rest of it, the arms, and the torso are a perfect fit.There is a little fan at the waist that is powered by 4 AA batteries.  The fan fills up the costume by blowing air into it, and there are elastic cuffs at the ankles, wrists, and neck.  One cool thing is that the fan has a USB (A) connector, so if you‚Äôre out of batteries or need something that will last a long time, you can connect it to a rechargeable battery pack because of the USB connection.  I tested that and it worked.

  I'm 5'3 200lbs and 42DDNegatives- the string to tie the center of the chest ISN""T what is pictured. It was too short and wide...also its more of a goldish color and I had to use tweezers to help me string it through the eyelets. The eyelets - some were smaller than others and some were pretty big, some of them weren't in line with the others. It took the entire string to use all the eyelets and once its tied its too pulled together so it takes away the ""sexy"" effect the picture shows...Also, with wearing a bra you will see the bra through that area no matter how tight it is because the eyelets stretch so far and show cleavage. My boobs actually are too big for the chest area and the lone ""belt"" under the chest actually sits ontop on my boobs instead of under where its supposed to be- with a bra its easier to adjust by pulling your bra and boobs up higher and then they set where they are supposed to be but im sure much arm movement and it'll go back to being on top of the. The arms where the holes are cut for the off the shoulder look were a little tight.Positives- The colors were very bright and pretty! the quality of the costume is better than I expected!over all I would recommend this costume but be warned you NEED A SIZE UP! It came fast in the mail but im debating on if I should risk sending it back to order a bigger size and it not getting here or just wearing it since its for a family party and I'll only be using it for one night....

  My guys love to play dress up. My four-year-old was so excited when this arrived. He tried it on and then insisted on wearing it everywhere (the grocery store, church, to pick up his big brother from school). It fit him well (He usually wears a 4T or  5T in clothing).My only real complaint is that the sizing band that goes inside the helmet continually separates from the helmet, and it was a little to difficult for my son to snap it back in on his own. Other than that, the quality seems really good. He loves that he can put it on and take it off by himself. So many of his costumes have velcro in the back, but this one has velcro in the front.This has been a great costume for imaginative play.

  After reading the reviews, I ordered a men's medium for my almost 12 year old daughter.  She is 5 ft 1 inches and about 80 to 85 pounds. (Skinny kid)  She loves Spider-man and wanted to be Spider-man (for about the 4th year in a row!) but didn't want a costume that had ""muscles"" on it since she was a girl.  This fit perfectly.  It did have some extra room in it, but not too much... if you have some ""extra"" in the belly area, it may not fit as well.  She really looked like Spider-Man from the movies!! Everyone absolutely LOVED her in the costume.  The face mask has holes in the mouth area, the eye area, and maybe the nose area (I can't remember), but they are tiny enough holes that you don't notice unless you are up close to her, but large enough that she was fine wearing it all day.  It also held up pretty well.  She wore it to an indoor Halloween Trick or Treat event, traditional outdoor Trick or Treating, and to school for the Halloween/ Harvest Fest Parade (she's in 6th grade).  The head mask is attached to the whole outfit, so when she wore it to school (she wore it all day), she had to keep the mask down until the parade-time.  When it's down, it falls in front of her head, rather than in the back (like a hoodie) like we expected.  But she didn't mind at all.  Also, it is all one-piece, so I have no idea how the whole restroom-thing went!  It must have been fine b/c I didn't ask and she didn't volunteer anything!

  My little boy loves this outfit, he has lived in it since he received it for Christmas. He is tall but thin so will wear it for a couple of years, it has held up nicely since he wears it daily, I've had to sew the pocket once, but I think that's because we bought him real handcuff and they are heavier than the plastic ones( he kept breaking the toy handcuff) we also made copies of the ticket so he can write tickets everyday, he's really into being a policeman, so much so that he looks like he missing something if he doesn't wear the hat.

  Very happy with the purchase! As many other reviews stated, the quality of the fabric and hard plastic hat are top notch and durable. Definitely believe it to be sufficient to hold up to washing. Also my son loves the battery operated siren! My only complaint is regarding the name badge pocket. The red dye of the suit appears to have dyed the plastic as well so when the included name badge sits all the way at the bottom of the pocket, you see red streaks all over his name and picture. Will not be sending back as he will need it for Halloween this year and hopefully no one notices the red badge!

  This costume is really nice, easy to wear, perfect for Halloween! (and, frankly, for lounging around playing video games). It's comfortable - cheap material, of course, but still comfortable - and warm. Here are my main points:1. Sizing - definitely order 1-2 sizes larger than you usually wear. I wear L usually; I got XL in this and I'm so glad I did because the XL is snug on me and I had to stretch the fabric slightly to get it to zip up all the way. So order 1 size larger if you want it snug, 2 if you want wiggle room.2. Construction - it's polyester so don't dry it in a machine or this costume will wind up even smaller than it originally was! But for the price, the fabric is pretty good and the seams are all sewn together well. The 'fur' on the hood and ears is really soft and nice, the hood is big enough to drape down on the forehead a bit which is nice. I'm impressed with the zipper too, which is a nice fat one instead of those cheap 'invisible' ones that always snag on the fabric and quickly break.3. Wearability - 10/10, this is great! Easy, comfortable. Definitely warm so that's nice for trick-or-treating outside, but may be a bit too hot at a crowded party indoors. Of course in that case you can always unzip it and still wear the wings and hood. Do plan on wearing shorts or leggings because this is just a jacket, no bottoms included.Overall, I'm thrilled. :) My favorite costume for years!

  Ordered this for a fun Halloween costume as you might expect. Got it and put batteries in. Fan wouldn‚Äôt turn on. Got new batteries, checked their voltage and fan still would not turn on. Item also appears to have been opened prior to me getting it, so someone else probably returned it as well. So dumb, why is it this hard to sell customers products that actually do what they are supposed to.Had it actually worked, it was way over priced for what you got. I paid $60 and the costume was a thin, very thin, nylon, the fan was probably a $.45 part, made in China prominently displayed on the battery cover.Really dumb, I should know better.

  I was looking for a low maintenance costume that looked good while still gave me the comfort of being in it all night. This fit my needs perfectly. I went with the Large as I'm 6'2 215 and it fit pretty well. The velcro bands on the side that are meant to give the costume a more tailored look were helpful, but I was still unable to completely fill out the costume around the waste. It wasn't too bad, but if you are tall and really slender you may have to get it altered.

  We purchased this dress up outfit to be my 4 year old's Halloween costume this year and are so pleased with it. In comparison to one of the cruddy costumes sold at the big box stores this thing will not tear easily, its not see through and it comes with all its accessories (instead of having to buy them piece meal). My son has worn it to 2 costume parties and a haunted house adventure and so far its holding up great to regular little boy rough play time! The only addition I made was a red neck kerchief and that I borrowed from last years cowboy costume. I'd have to say this is a hit in our house and we will be buying some of the other sets as Yule gifts.

  I'm actually surprised how well the costume fit considering I'm on the shorter side on humanity. I can't speak for all heights here, but the comfort zone is broad--probably ranging from 4'10"" up to over 6' tall.  From a width perspective, anything more than a size 44 jacket is likely going to be a bit tight.The only detractors I can think of is that it can be a little difficult to see out of for longer distances and it seals well with little air escaping. This means it gets really warm in there and any gas passed doesn't blend quickly into the atmosphere. I've been hearing for years about how horrible my methane discharge was, but until I wore this costume, I never gave it much thought or consideration.  One medium blow from the back-facing fog horn was all it took. I almost threw up. I'm not saying that family, friends, children, neighbors, and passers-by are/were necessarily correct in their assessment of lethality, but after a couple hours sealed into this costume, I'm at least ready willing to concede there may be some validity.HDF

  received this today for my 2-yr-old grandson who is obsessed with construction sites (check out the book ""goodnight, goodnight construction site"").  that particular book got him interested, and now he's in the middle of a full blown construction vehicle obsession.  I am enjoying it beyond words.  He put on his little vest - real reflective tape! just like the real thing.  there are several pockets and loops in which to place the hammer and saw that come with the outfit!  The goggles are dear, but he's a two year old, not going to happen. The only problem I found is with the helmet.  It's well made, only it just doesn't fit.  The inner band allows for adjustment, but it isn't enough.  Maybe older children have no problem with it.Today, I took him to a construction site.  We were able to stand by the fence, me holding my favorite little guy, while he was wearing his construction hat..  He watched mesmerized for an hour, and that's saying something for a 2 yr old.  The worker operating the digger got out and said, ""I like your hat"".  Well , need I say more.  Then cutest grin you've ever seen on a guy with a safety helmet, and I'm referring to both of them.

  My 2-yr-old is not old enough to go to the Bippidi Boppidi salon at Disney World, but her cousin was going so we bought this dress to princessify my daughter so she wouldn't be jealous. It's a beautiful dress and the 3T fit my almost 3-yr-old perfectly. It's very good quality, the fabric is soft and the seams are solid and serged. They used several different fabrics to give it depth. I was impressed that they put a half-slip inside the crinoline to keep it from being scratchy. It mostly stood up to one day in the park and one day of traveling through airports (she refused to wear anything else to travel home). One seam near the bottom did rip so I'll have to repair that, but she's a rambunctious toddler. Overall, I'd recommend this dress and buy others from this company.

  I was skeptical of the quality because of the price, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It was a bit awkward to get into the first time, but after watching a video online, I figured out that it's best to put the legs on first, pull them up like putting on a pair of pants, then sit down and basically ""bend in"" to the rest of the suit. Since I can't always count on having someone around to close it up, I was happy that the zipper is pretty easy to zip from the inside. I was also skeptical that the one small fan would ""blow up"" the suit, but in a couple of minutes, I was transformed into a T-rex that was almost too large for my tiny living room! Even though the air flow is good, I did take the advice from some other T-rexes and purchased a second fan that I've not installed yet. Not only good as a backup, I think it will help keep me cooler while wearing it. It wasn't terribly hot inside, but I was in an air-conditioned house. The battery pack is fully detachable from the fan making folding/storing easy. It is pretty compact when folded and will fit in a suitcase easily.

  My boyfriend wanted to be Robin Hood in their company's Halloween party. We were looking for costumes until we found this. We ordered and expected that what is in the picture is exactly the same we'll get.We were amazed that we got what we saw in the picture. My boyfriend loves the quality of the material used. It isn't cheap leather but not an expensive one either. This is definitely worth recommending to guys who want to be Robin Hood on Halloween.

  Adorable costume, as long as you only intend to use it once or twice. If you wash it once (even hand washing), it literally falls apart. The mustache is huge for a kid's face, so we had to cut it back, but it was SO cute. The hat lasts longer than the rest of the outfit. The whole thing runs VERY small. Order at least 1 size larger than you think you need. Also is extremely thin- child will need to wear shirt/pants underneath. Especially if it's cold outside.

  My kid loves this. He wore it for Halloween. It was a little big on him (he‚Äôs only two), but it stayed on and he seemed comfortable. He used it for playtime in the days that followed. It‚Äôs not perfect - helmet interior band does not stay on, and name tag is just paper. Also, the goggles are surprisingly fragile, and the vision part can pop out and be sharp if it breaks (had to take them away after they broke).

  I ordered one size above my usual size (normally 1X/2X, I ordered the 3X/4X), and the fit was great.  I'm not super into Halloween... so this was a good costume to be relatively ""low effort,"" but still in the spirit of the celebration.  My one complaint is that there is no good reason there are NO pockets on this hoodie!  A friend of mine was Cinderella, and her perfect fancy blue dress had pockets... not even one little pocket on this hoodie?  Just seems wrong!  (A minor complaint, though, for an otherwise fine product.)

  Okay, so this was a crazy thing to buy but my daughter insisted.....It is awesome !  My daughter is only 5 ft 1 inch and she wore this to our Church Trunk or Treat festival the day before Halloween.  She was the hit of the night !!  All the kids loved her.  The costume fit well (we were concerned that she might be too short).  The only problem she had was due to the weather - it was near record breaking heat that day and very humid so her vision was fogged several times.  I finally gave her a towel to wipe the inside and that helped.  Once it got cooler outside (and the humidity dropped) she was able to breathe and not fog up her screen.  She walked around the parking lot area for hours and the costume held up just fine.

  Kid likes it, but helmet suspension doesn't adjust properly or fasten well with little push tabs like on back of cheap caps but less secure.  The suspension only tightens in front and back, the sides are fixed, so it gets square shaped when I tighten and it won't stay with only 2 tabs pushed in.  I can't get it small enough for 3yo, but helmet is sturdy and good kid size. Would be fine for bigger boys or maybe when my daughter is closer to 5.  The jacket is great, but even my 3yo knows how a megaphone is supposed to work, and it only plays a siren, she still likes it. The extinguisher would be much better if it had some type of hose to aim. Firefighters have hoses, so just a 9 inch piece of rubber tube would have made this magical for her, so I'm going to modify it.

  I'm really torn on how to review this. On one hand, it is incredibly cute, and I love wearing it. The ears and wings are especially darling. On the other, the material is super cheap and bit unpleasant. Also, I wear a small in literally every item of clothing...except for this costume. I'm a size 4, and I had to order an XL so that I didn't feel like a sausage squeezed into a weird fleece casing. It is also very warm, as other reviewers have noted. (This is a plus for me, since I'm always cold, but if you tend to be even a little bit warm, this will probably be too hot for you to wear.)

It has stretch material on the shoulders which makes it hang nicely oh her even though it's big.  She loved it, I am happy.

  Das Kleid kam zugig an, sauber verpackt.Ich habe es gleich anprobiert und muss sagen, es sitzt gerade so. Ich trage normalerweise eine Konfektionsgr√∂√üe zwischen 36/38 und 40. Darum habe ich mich f√ºr 38/40 entschieden. Also, es h√§tte keinen cm enger sein d√ºrfen! Der Rei√üverschluss am R√ºcken geht beim bewegen der Arme sofort auf, diesen musst ich jetzt mit einer Sicherheitsnadel verschlie√üen um sicherzugehen, dass das Kleid da bleibt, wo es hingeh√∂rt ;)Auf dem Foto sieht das Kleid relativ kurz aus, es geht jedoch bis zu den Kniescheiben TROTZ separat dazugekauftem Unterrock der nicht enthalten ist. Dies habe ich in einer Kundenrezension als Empfehlung gelesen und gleich dazu bestellt.  Ansonsten h√§ngt das Kleid ""schlapp"" am K√∂rper runter.Ich denke, f√ºr den Abend an dem ich das Kost√ºm nun ben√∂tige, ist es in Ordnung, man muss eben etwas tricksen und hier und da was √§ndern oder verbessern, aber das ist machbar. Daf√ºr hat man aber auch ordentlich Geld investiert (zus√§tzlicher Unterrock, Strumpfhose, Per√ºcke... ) und das w√ºrde ich mir beim n√§chsten Kauf nochmal genau √ºberlegen. Das ist ein nicht ganz so g√ºnstiger Spa√ü

  Got this for Halloween because it's impossible to find a sexy costume that isn't borderline streetwalker - as a mom I like that the zip front allows for my choice of boob exposure. The costume is a bit longer than the photo, but I'm fine with that. It's comfy - the material feels a bit like a thick soft felt. The tail at the back is very heavy and cumbersome, so my simple solution was just to bring it around front and pin it to the side of the dress. I'm 5'10"" and size 8-10, so the large fit perfectly.  Will style with red Converse high tops. All in all I'm happy with the purchase.

  Purchased this for my 6 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. I couldn't get her to take it off once she realized she had some cute cowgirl boots to match. It fit her great and didn't show too much leg. The ribbons on the dress are adjustable. You can easily weed them into another part of the dress. That made it great because we ended up making two shoulder straps with the ribbons. My only downer, the ""cow"" material could've been attacked a little better. My daughter likes to explore her outfits and she pulled it right off with a simple tug. Could've been a simple error. It was a quick fix. Definitely looking forward to finding more costumes like this one.

  This costume is beyond beautiful! I purchased it to wear to my 4-year old Niece‚Äôs Princess Birthday Party. And let me say, it was ab-so-lute-ly PERFECT! My Niece and her little toddler friends thought I was a real Princess! Honestly, I felt like a real Princess!The sizes run small, but I still gave 5 stars because it just looked so darn fabulous! I usually wear 18W/20W. I ordered this costume in size 3X-4X and it was an exact fit. It includes the headband and choker, but DOES NOT include gloves, so be sure to order the gloves to complete the look.

  This costume is very cute, but not without flaws.  I do like the fact that it's a V-neck when zipped, because that's more comfortable to me. I expected the sizing to be a little off, but it's much smaller than I'd figured on. I bought a Large, and it's skin tight when zipped (and it's not flattering when it's that tight, it makes 'rolls' and lumps where I don't have them). I think I'll have to return this for a 1X, so that I can zip it comfortably with a light t-shirt under it.  Also, it's polyester felt -- not stretchy, ridiculously hot, and not breathable at all.  It feels like if you tug at it, the fabric will stretch into thin strips and tear apart.  For the warmth, if you live in the Midwest and sit outside in below-40-degree weather half of the time at Halloween like we do, you won't even need a coat when wearing this -- but you *will* be drenched in sweat because it's polyester.

  The dress in and of itself was ok, it did run large on me. However, I bought ""Brand New"" and when I opened the dress, it had smeared makeup and lipstick on the inside and also sweat stains in the armpits. Needless to say, it did not smell well either. Luckily, amazon stepped up to the plate and helped correct things with a different manufacturer. I ended up getting the same dress from a different manufacturer in a smaller size. I am 5'8"", with a 38D chest and the medium fit me best. Definitely recommend getting a petticoat, it falls flat on its own.

  I was very disappointed with this purchase. The location and output of the fan did not meet my expectations. The fan is very high in the waist causing the air output to be restricted making the head of the Raptor almost floppy the whole night. Also within the first night of use the material tore where the neck and waist meet. As far as the look of the inflatable it was ok. Looked like the photos but unfortunately it did not even make it one night. Considering contacting the company for a refund.

Out of the three outfits there was only one defect (missing earpiece on stethoscope). The outfits all have pockets, velcro closures, headpieces, name tags, and at least 3 accessories that make play dress up so much fun for my 4 1/2 year old. The size of the outfits are appropriate as well. They make great Halloween costumes, too, and are so much less expensive.

  Longer than I thought it would be based on the image... (how is it that short on her when the sleeves seem to reach all the way to her hands?)Also mine came with a raisin?? Like... a shriveled grape. It was a large raisin as it seemed to be half of one, but still the size of a typical sun-maid raisin. But it probably wasn‚Äôt a sun-maid raisin because it was reddish rather than black. And as I said, half of this one was the size of a whole sun-maid raisin. I didn‚Äôt taste test it or anything. I just threw it out and put the dress on.I was hoping it would be shorter on me but it goes pretty low. Being a guy, I was hoping it would be more of a hoodie than a dress hoodie. But whatever. The sleeves are almost too short but they‚Äôre not. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 125 lbs  and ordered a medium. It is very warm, light weight, and soft. I think I look cute.

  My daughter wanted to be a doctor for Halloween so I figured this coat would be perfect for her.  It was beautiful!  Very well made and everything fits neatly in it's own pocket.  I did not even attempt to put batteries in the stethoscope since the other reviewers said it made a horrible noise and really, my 3 1/2 year old doesn't care if it makes noise or not. My only complaints are that on Amazon.com it says the age is 3-4 years and when I received it the package said 3-6 years so as you can imagine it was VERY large on my 3 1/2 year old but that just means she will be able to use it as a dress up play coat for a longer time.  My other problem is the ear buds on the stethoscope didn't even fit in her ears a little...they just fell right out!  She wore it around her neck so it worked out but they should really work on fixing that.  Other than those 2 issues, I loved this doctor coat and so did my daughter.

  I have previously been happy with Melissa and Doug products, but this was a big disappointment. The costume is well-constructed and seemingly durable. Sizing seems appropriate. The accessories, however, fall far short of expectations. The bullhorn makes a sound by pushing a button. That's difficult for a 3 year old. The picture as part of packaging shows a girl speaking into it so I expected amplification. Not true. The fire extinguisher can be filled with water. All I can figure out is that the bottle needs to be squeezed to expel a water stream. That's impossible for 3 year old hands. When squeezed, it leaks since the screw on head is not a seal. The hat has adjustments for fitting. It's difficult to explain the inadequacies of the plastic insert band for adjustments, but once again a disappointment.

  This is a really fun costume. I got one for myself and for my dinosaur partner-in-crime. I'm 5 foot 5 and he is 6 foot 3. The adult one-size works for both of us (although I obviously have more space for myself inside the costume than he does lol).It is a little tricky getting into the costume at first, but once you figure it out it is pretty easy.It does get quite hot inside the T-rex. So weather is a factor. But it feels pretty comfortable in the 70s. I could probably even do short trips outside in the 80s or 90s.We are going to use this for more than just Halloween. We are doing a video series called 31 Days in the life of a Dinosaur, starting October 1st.But overall I am VERY happy with this purchase and recommend it to anyone with a good sense of humor :)

  I really wanted to like this costume, but there is a major design flaw with this one. The body suit does not have any opening in the crotch area, how are you supposed to use the bathroom?? You literally have to take off the entire costume to use the bathroom. Also the body suit is super sheer, so I had to wear black tights underneath. I am 5'3'' and 115 lbs, medium build. The long fabric in the front and back, I had to shorten it at least by 2 inches even with heels on. Definitely something I wouldn't wear again!

  We've really enjoyed this costume. It would have gotten 5 stars but the neck is super tight and it seems that there should be a way to make it comfortable while still being adjustable. But yes.. we ordered one to play with during covid... because you know we need as many ways as possible to entertain ourselves.  Since then, we've ordered several more inflatable costumes.

  I wanted to write a review because sizing info is so hard to pin down on this costume.  After much debate on whether or not we should risk the youth version of this or try the adult size for a 9yo, we ended up going with the adult version and it's perfect!  He's 9 years old and 4' 6"".  He can see perfectly.  The costume is comedic, which is exactly what he was going for.  I wouldn't recommend this for a party where there a lot of activities or isn't much space though.I have this four stars because the fan was a little disappointing and it took a long time for the costume to inflate.

  My 16 year old is around size 10 and the XL was tight and bunched up terribly on her.  She gave it to her skinny 13 year old sister and it fits perfectly, (she would be around a women's small- small/med).  We sized up to a 3x for eldest, which was a touch long for her taste, but nice and flowy, like she wanted.  (I like the length since she can raise her arms without showing off her butt.)  Highly recommend ordering one or two sizes up.

  First off I‚Äôd like to say, but I tend to buy a lot of costumes. Once in a while you find a costume that you to want to wear out in public, not just on Halloween. This is exactly that.  The cut of this dress is so flattering that I would love to take it to a seamstress and make like 20 of these in different colors and materials. In addition, it is extremely comfortable. And to top it off, it‚Äôs just really cute and fun. I also purchased a vest with fringe on Amazon that comes with some cool 60s glasses. I plan to wear this with some Minnetonka high suede boots and I think I‚Äôll just feel and look fabulous. At this price you have nothing to lose!

  I was very excited about receiving this costume but when I opened the packaging not only did it not have the neck scarf or the hat, it was also WAY too big. I am 5'1, 116 lbs and I wasn't for sure if the Small would fit but after looking after the reviews it seemed as if the costume ran small. In my case, it was way too baggy/long and to me (of course) it looked nothing like the picture. I will be getting a refund for this costume

  5'8'' 160lb Guy here. I ordered a M/L and the dress fit exactly how I thought it would. Neckline was not too low but exposed a lot of chest hair. The skirt lies just above the knee, but I was hoping it would be shorter. The corset is fully adjustable like a shoelace, and was actually pretty roomy for a M/L, I might have been able to get a S/M but I didn't want to risk it. The fringe on the top is a little itchy on your neck, but it's not too bad. I would recommend thigh-highs, red pumps, and a petticoat (which is not included), but obviously I'm not gonna invest in those for one night. Looks pretty good for a hairy man in a dress not gonna lie.If I can say it looks good on me, then it would look better on any girl, so keep that in mind.

  We bought both the V-raptor and T-rex costumes.  They are both hilarious and awesome looking.  The T-rex costume has separate gloves and zips in the front.  This means you can get into the costume yourself, turn the fan on, and then zip it up without assistance from someone else.  You can also actually take the gloves off and do things (ie. drink beer.)The V-raptor costume has blow up hands attached to it and zips in the back.  I have no idea why they put the zippers in different places, but with the blow up hands and back zipper you pretty much need assistance from another person to zip up.  You also cannot really do anything while wearing it with the blow up hands.  I was hoping to drink beer and hand out candy, but that probably won't work. LOL.

  I was the last alien in a line of 7 at a bluegrass music festival. We decided to walk up the path to main stage in a single file line and I have never laughed so hard in my life!!! It was July and hot so at first the constant air flow around your body which exits around you neck, ankles and wrists was quite nice but 30 minutes into us dancing and parading around the thing is just circulating hot air and now hot air is blowing out around your neck and face. Now I am still laughing at the entire scene when I realize the legs of my costume (which is like a parachute material) is now sticking to my sweaty legs and forcing me to waddle!!! WADDLE! Now I'm dieing of laughter! We make as quick of a run as was physically possible to get back to camp to get these things off that now feel our own personal saunas! I highly recommend them! We had a blast and were stopped several times for photos! The only other downside is sometimes the battery packs and fan/air intake fall off but after a quick snap back together they kept working! #campmotherfuckinfuckyeah

  I ordered a size up after reading reviews. I love this costume. It is incredibly warm and indeed cozy. While it seems to be made just out of cheap felt or fleece, it still is very warm. I had some loose strings that were easy to cut. I wore this costume with a long-sleeved black shirt underneath, fleece-lined leggings, and black boots. I also wore a bat mask and false sharp canine teeth. People complimented me on my costume. Because I was going to an outdoor party, I wanted something warm, and I got it. I think with fishnet leggings or other pants, and no shirt underneath, this would work just as well for an indoor party as well.

  So here's the issue with the suit. I have a 16 year old son who is 5'9 and weighs 125 pounds. Tall and slender kid. He put the suit on all excited to wear it but it was really wonky. It was almost too tight length wise but the width was really wide. He looked like a flying squirrel in it. He was super bummed out. Maybe for an older man it would work but for a tall teen it just didn't work

  I bought this for my son to wear to the renaissance festival. I knownthe white one is the girl dragon, but I didn't want him to be too hot because we live in Arizona. The festival is in March and temps can be either cool in the 60s or warm in the 80s. The costume is great quality and very soft. The inside lining is a comfortable fabric so it won't make him itchy. I bought a size up in hopes that he could wear it for halloween too. It is a bit big, but I expected that. As far as sizing goes, it is pretty true to size listed. The zipper is nice too cuz it makes for easy diaper changes. I also like that the feet are separate so he can wear shoes with it instead.

  This costume is hands down the best thing you could wear to any party, you will always be the center of attention!I've had it for a year now and have worn it on a few occasions besides Halloween. It's well made and the fan does it's job of blowing up the costume but I did wish the fan was a little bit more powerful because if you sit down a lot of the air comes out through the wrists and ankles and when you stand up it takes a while to inflate again.The biggest drawback to this costume is how hot it will get inside, and that the plastic window will fog up to the point that you cannot see out of it at all. Which is why I took 1 star off. I may add a second fan to it to help with this.I will say, women love this costume, if only women came up to me in person as much as they do when I have this costume on.....

  Let me just say.. the product idea and the amount of material given to pull it off is awesome. I was in love with it when I seen it online and loved almost everything about it when I received it today and tried it on. The only thing I don‚Äôt care for about it is that you really can see much head from a frontal view. It‚Äôs mostly the open mouth and you can‚Äôt tell what you‚Äôre looking at. The reason why I gave this two stars is because.. as I tried it on a second time to show fianc√©e.. the zipper came off. It looks impossible to put it back on and now I feel as if I wasted money!

  I bought the larger size because it had prime shipping (even though i'd typically get sm/med).  It still fit okay so I think this is a super tight fitting dress.  The only place it was loose was the straps, but not in a noticeable way to others.  Good product for the price.  It is really short though.  I wore short black shorts underneath.

  I bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 year old (who is about the size of an average 5 year old).  I was impressed by the quality of materials in the jacket.  My son has really enjoyed playing with this kit.I deducted one star due to the cheapness of the inside fitting for the fire helmet.  The sizer doesn't stay snapped leading to it becoming loose and falling off often. Other than that, it's a great product.

  I knew those was going to be small, so I sized up. I wear this all the time, everywhere, i do not care how far from Halloween it is, it has become almost a signature piece of mine. I usually wear an xl, and I got a xxxl and it fit (almost) perfectly. Little tight in the chest area, but it's okay. The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the need to size up, I knew because I read reviews ahead of time, but some people may not know.

  I'm 6 ft 2 in and around 185lbs and this thing fits great.  It takes a little bending over and wiggling to get the thing on, but once you get it over your head there is plenty of room inside and it fits great.  It does get warm quickly though, but I imagine if it was cool outside you would be just fine.I immediately used the costume to scare my wife as she came home from work.  It was a successful scare followed by some laughs.  I'm hoping it lasts for years to come as this thing will always be good for a laugh.In a year where everyone could use a little smile and a laugh I think this is a great thing to buy.

  My husband and I were both impressed with the quality of this suit.  I bought it for halloween, but had asked a friend who bought it what the quality was, and she said excellent.  It isn't plasticy, it's durable and comfortable.  I haven't put batteries in the bull horn yet, but my son hasn't noticed.  The badge does come off fairly easily, I'm thinking about stitching it on so it stays on better.  The piece inside the hat that sizes it fell out, but he likes wearing it regardless and it's easy to snap back in.  I have a feeling this will be played with for a couple years.

  I got this costume for the past Halloween. Even thought it says SWAT on the front, it is hard to tell it is a SWAT officer without accessorizing correctly. It kind of looks like a normal dress. The armband and thighband were a little tight (I got size medium/large and am about 5 feet, 135 lbs) but wearable. The fingerless gloves were just made of a light fabric and fit pretty well. I wouldn't suggest purchasing unless you have other things ready to accompany the officer. Or if you're crafty and have the time, I think it wouldn't be hard to make this outfit yourself at home.Side note: not sure if will happen in future, I saw a lot of other people wearing same costume around!

  Per other reviews, this fits VERY small.  By the measurement chart, I would have been an XL, but thanks to other reviewers' advice, I purchased a 3X, which fit perfectly.  TRUST the reviewer sizing on this...the cut and fit is much, much smaller than the charts proclaim.  That said, the costume is super-cute.  The body is fleece, jacket-weight, and the hood (as pictured) is black fun-fur.  It looks just like the photo.  :)  I'm really happy with it, and have no doubts I'll be nice and warm!  I would have rated this item 5-stars because I love it overall, but had it not been for other helpful reviewers, it would have been too small to wear.

  cute idea but the hot as heck! Thick material and the piece in the front of your thighs is way too long. Looks like a boy bat if you know what I mean. So if you live in a climate that it is warm at Halloween time I would keep looking. Also, the ears look like a bear instead and your as warm as a bear.

  Costume is you basic costume store outfit that you would buy at a Halloween store. It fit as described but I returned it because the hat was smashed in the center and there was a red/pinkish small stain on the leg.

  I bought this costume for Halloween as it seemed to be the only Sally costume that looked true to the movie version rather than the short skirted, ""sassy"" or altered versions. I'm 5' 8"" and 135"" and a 38B and the large fit well. I think the medium size would have been a little too tight and I can adjust the back with the ties to make it more form fitting if I want to. The only thing I didn't like about the costume is that the back is just a thin, pink material. You would have thought that the manufacturer would have used the same pattern in the back as in the front. Even if I had to pay a bit more, it would have made the costume 5-stars. I also didn't care for the yarn wig, which I replaced with another wig. The stitch sleeves come with the costume and it is a nice overall costume for a few hours of Halloween fun.

  My grandson loves hats so this was great to wear while he played with his new train he received for Christmas.  When I showed him how the radio made real train sounds he thought that was the best but the radio lasted about two minutes and then the sounds became distorted and just alot of very loud noise.  I removed the battery and replaced it to see if that would do anything (It didn't) I have to say the radio is just a piece of plastic junk.  Amazon is replacing with free return and replacement, hopefully the replacement lasts long enough to allow my grandson to enjoy it.

  I gave this 5 stars because my nephew LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (And I loved the price!!!)  I originally purchased it because my sister said he likes pretending he has a walkie talkie and talking like a cop every so often after he gets home from Pre-K. My nephew is in the phase of loving everything little boys usually love..monster trucks, muscle car toys, Nintendo D.S., all of which he got for Christmas.  With that being said, we purposely had this as one of his last gifts to open knowing he would be overwhelmed (he's 4) and preoccupied by other gifts he received though out the day.  I can't even explain how EXCITED he was when he saw it.  He had to put it RIGHT ON and he wore it the rest of the evening, even wore it for the car ride home :)  Great gift and great memories.

  I actually just returned this. Daughter was obsessed with being a bat for Halloween, but suddenly wants to be Peppa instead. The costume is well made, and decently thick. Older daughter just turned 3, and the XS fit her perfectly.

He continues to play with the costume. The material is good quality. The horn actually makes a firetruck sound. The hat is a little large and even with the plastic insert to adjust it, it kept coming off. I decided to secure it inside with some hot glue, but otherwise, I have no real complaints. The jacket is thick enough to wear on cooler days. I like the attachment holder for the fire extinguisher. The jacket hits my son in his thighs.

  Ok, this thing does have some flaws but the funny factor outweighs all of them and had to give this five stars just for that.  My 13 year old grandson wore this for Halloween and it was the funniest thing ever and drew a lot of attention.  It is reported that it is difficult to run (funny to watch) and you don't have much use of hands with the gloves on.  This is pretty cool and has a built in fan that keeps it inflated.

  1st, I have to say that amazon had the best price I found. Melissa and Doug can get a little pricey because of where it is sold so I was so happy to save the extra $6-$8. 2nd, I was a little worries about the sizing after reading some reviews, but it was perfect for us! My son just turned 4 and wearing a regular 4 size clothing and this is just a little big on him. So there is room to grow and get that much more for my money! 3rd, all the pieces that come with it really make it a great deal! The radio is the favorite for my son, only needs a 9 volt battery. But it sounds fun and realistic with the little effects it makes. Next we'll be ordering the Fireman set!

  First let me say that the only reason I knocked off a star is that this costume was a bit smaller than expected. It does fit my son and we're keeping it as he will be wearing it within the month and will probably still be able to get into it for at least the next few months (something my kids love to do with their Halloween costumes) when he wants it to play around. But it is almost a bit tight in the waist although my son is only a size 7 and very very slim (we purchased the 7/8). Not uncomfortably so, but if you're in doubt, I'd recommend getting the next size up from what you think your child should be wearing.With that said, yes, it's a bit flimsy as would be expected for a once-wear item, but it's adorable and my son absolutely loves it. The hat is super-cute as well. The green is very vibrant, just like the video game and just what we were looking for. I really couldn't beat the price, either. I saw this exact costume on other sites and via other sellers and this was the lowest price I found. So I was very happy about that.My son is running all over the house in it right now and can't wait to wear it for his Halloween parade at school.

  I got this for my 4years old son for his Halloween dress up. He loves to play pretend and wish to be a police officer. This costume is very nice material and come with a lot of accessories. I always love this brand because of their quality material costume. It runs a little big for my boy, but I guess he can wear it again next year. One minor thing is I wish they have a place to put the handcuffs and the whistle rather than having the boy to hold it.

  The back was a slightly shear strange Pepto Bismo pink color rather than having the same print as the front and the wig was sparse. I does however have a few redeeming qualities: The XL is true to size, the turtleneck style collar is shorter and looks better than the picture, and it is comfortable. Also the ordering and shipping was seamless.

My ankles and a little of my legs show some, so I will probably wear longer socks when I wear this costume out.

  Perfectly timed for Halloween! My nephew desperately wanted to be a race car driver. His insistence came from finding a motorcycle helmet in the garage, so we knew a helmet was a must. We were elated to be able to give this to him!He is an average sized 5 year old, and the suit fit him just perfectly. He is 43lbs and 41 inches tall. The gathered cuffs make it easily adjusted for many sizes and heights. The zippered suit is simple but easy to put on and take off.The helmet was a thick plastic, which is an upgrade from those other kits where the helmets feel so thin that you know it will break any moment.The addition of the foam steering wheel helps add to the costume. However, this is more for the role play then to carry if you trick or treat. It becomes a hinderance when carrying a bucket and going door to door. Fortunately, it is light so it will be easy for mom and dad to juggle.

  I've heard good things about Melissa & Doug but this was a bit disappointing. My 2.5 y/o nephew didn't want to wear the coat, which was actually pretty well made. He played with the thermometer, stethoscope, and the shot. He didn't want to wear the stethoscope on his ears but he liked letting others listen. The tools should have a box or kit to be stored in because they won't stay in the pockets very well. The sound on the stethoscope should come through the ears, not at the heart.

  It was a hit at work for our costume party! I wasn't sure of what size to buy, so I went with the 1x. I ended up getting it altered a bit and hemmed at the bottom. I figured it was better to buy it and have it be too big than deal with returning it and getting a different size. I also bought sparkly jelly shoes on Amazon to go with the costume! A definite win at work!! Update: wore costume for 8 hrs at work. Despite glitter all over my desk chair, lol ...the only real complaint is that the sleeves by the armpits were a little uncomfortable.

  My 3.5 year old daughter told me I needed to be Cinderella for Halloween this year, so I bought this dress and it was LEGIT. After reading the reviews I also bought a hoop skirt for underneath and I think that was a good call. It made the dress a lot more full and ""princessy"". The dress comes with the blue headband and black choker. I bought the wig, opera gloves, and hoop skirt separately. I bought the L size. I typically wear a size 10 clothes. I have a large bust (36DDD) so sometimes, finding dresses that fit appropriately all over is a challenge. But the L worked out well and I even felt like it may have been slightly large in some places. I am 5'6 and this dress was VERY long, even with the hoop underneath. I had to hold it up to walk (I was wearing flats). Halloween was a great success, however, and numerous little girls in our neighborhood stopped to take pictures with me while we were trick or treating. You will BRING the Cinderella in this costume. It is a good buy.

  It looks incredible.  Fits a little bit small, so make sure you follow the size chart and maybe go over if you're in between sizes.  The zipper in the back is really difficult to get too with one person, so having assistance will get the thing on much quicker.  Once it's on though, you look identical to spiderman's original costume including the red spider on the back.  Oh, and it's a bit difficult to see out of, but not too bad.

  Went to a Halloween store to try this and buy it bUT saw the price for $79.99! I immediately checked amazon and found this for $39. Same exact item even same manufacturer. Rip off Halloween stores. The only thing is the size of costume in store differ from what is offered on here. I tried on a medium and it fit perfect but the options here were small/medium, medium/large etc. I bought a medium/large and was a little big, but not too bad. Worth the huge savings!

  Let me just say this costume was a ""BIG HIT!"" I bought it for a Halloween costume party and I'm glad that I did, I received soooo many compliments. The material was not cheap looking, very comfortable and easy to move around in, and it's most def worth the buy. I'm 5'5 196 pounds and I purchased a large. I paired it with black and gold booties to make it more sexy! Outside of the gold strings on the arm making it a little tight everything else fit perfectly and hugs every curve if you're a curvy woman. I would most def recommend this costume.

  Great costume, but the arm and leg wraps fall down. it became a constant battle on halloween to keep them tied up. You need to sew or pin them in place some how to prevent them from falling down after wearing it more than a few minutes.

  The costume came in a timely manner, wrapped, and brand new.  It was the correct size, and the right costume.  The picture is decieving however, because the skirt is way shorter than the picture shows.  I normally wear a size 10 in jeans, and i ordered the M-L, which seemed to only be able to fit someone who was many sizes smaller than myself.  The arm band and the leg band were also made for someone who is way smaller.  I am not fat, but Im not the girl in the picture.  Other than that, the costume was cute, added with stretch pants or pantyhose.

  As per EVERY other review on here, the sizing does runs small... I am typically a medium, however sometimes I feel a bit fluffy and was worried so I did order a large. It fit okay. A medium would have fit, but def would have been on the sultry-curve hugging side, so a large is perfect for family trick or treating (it wasn't baggy anywhere).It's really warm, and well made. The tail isn't as heavy as others have led you to believe, and I have big hair so the hood doesn't flop over my face or anything. I'm also 5'8"" tall so it wasn't as long as it might be on other people, not inappropriately short, but about mid thigh. I am REALLY happy with this purchase. It's too cute and a great value!

  So let my start off by saying that this is one of the best quality costume dresses I‚Äôve ever seen! The quality is exceptional. It‚Äôs just lovely!! When I showed it to my husband he thought it was something I bought for myself! Also a great value with all the bells and whistles that all little girls love, the Tiara, gloves, earrings, etc. were all nicely packaged and looked to be intact. I wanted to get an array of costume dresses for my soon to be 4 year old for her birthday. She is very tall, like in the 90th percentile for height. I almost always have to size up for her for clothes and sadly I feel that every size chart is a guessing game due to different sellers, I have ordered the same size (6x140) in dresses/costumes/clothes as I did in this and they end up being too small....and this was at least two sizes too big, So this does in fact run VERY close to true size and if only I could trust size charts would I have picked her appropriate size, Or let‚Äôs say accurate size and then account for getting a size she can grow into. That being said, I have actually considered keeping this for two years so she will have one that fits her when she‚Äôs 6 or 7! It‚Äôs that beautiful! But who knows what she will like in 2-3 years so I‚Äôm going to return it for a smaller size, and get my younger daughter one as well! I have a two year old that loves playing dress up with her sister. Very pleased with this product and would recommend you go by this sellers sizing!

  My son loves this costume!  It is so cool and will make for a very fun Halloween experience!  The only thing I wish was that it had a stronger fan.  It blows up the whole dinosaur but the head does stay a bit floppy due to the lower air pressure but when he wears the strap around the neck it does hold the head up better.

  My son wanted to be a policeman for Halloween so this was perfect. He loves the handcuffs and walkie talkie. I am glad it doesn't come with a toy gun or weapon. It does come with an ID badge you can personalize with the child's name and photo, a whistle and a ""ticket."" I have had to wash it on gentle cycle and it held up well. It does come with a few small parts that are easy to lose, such as the badge on the hat, which kept falling off and was soon lost. But in general it's been a great buy.

  Love this. We picked up a couple of latex gloves at our last visit and added them to one of the pockets (these can be chocking hazard though, so, she ONLY plays with them supervised) .  She mostly plays with the jacket, syringe, stethoscope, otoscope, and those gloves, and ignores the other two things.  I do think it has helped her to be less worried about visiting the doctor.  Still freaks out of course, but, less so.  All of her babies and stuffed toys get looots of shots.  For some reason that seems to be the #1 favorite thing to do when playing doctor.

  I had read the reviews and ordered the medium size even though I mainly wear a small (5'3, 124 lbs). It's super comfortable, looks really fun just as expected.

  The costume is definitely a bit bigger than it should be. I almost ordered a medium, I probably should have gone for an XS if there even was the option. The quality of the material was quite good. The hat however was just a flat and flimsy piece of fabric that didn't have any shape to it whatsoever which was a bit disappointing. The costume did the job though.

You can still kinda grab things with them in the fins.I used this in the pouring rain in Milwaukee this past Halloween. I was soaked in 10 minutes. This is not waterproof. No matter. It stayed inflated. Everyone we met loved it and it was hilarious trying to find big puddles to stomp around in and dance around like a fool. And yes, more than one kid threw the baby shark song my way. A total blast!! My girlfriend just rolled her eyes but it didn't matter since I couldn't see her because the window was all fogged up.

The stitching and durability of this item are spot on. We have had the item for 3 months and it has been played with many times at home and shared in the daycare and it is showing no signs of wear and tear as of yet. Many hours of pretend play for the pre-k kids. There are so many things children learn through pretend play. This product is well worth the money. The children who have been playing with it are between the ages of 2 and 6 so it fits a wide range of sizes. The toys are made of hard durable plastic and the outfit is a durable fabric with great stitching.

  Great quality costume, metal badges. Stretchy material. Super cute, gotta get handcuffs separate, though. Got those for like 3 bucks at Wal-Mart. I think some reviews said the hat looked like a bus drivers, made me laugh when I saw it, kinda agreed but once you put the badge on it, didn't even think about it again. Wasn't the best made hat, but it's just for Halloween and it didn't give me any trouble all night. Was super on the fence for sizing, most reviews said do one size up, a few said go TWO sizes up. I figured this brand was just like all the teeny costumes I've tried on in Halloween stores so I ended up getting the XL instead of L. Was able to slide it on without even undoing the zipper in the back, like I said, very stretchy. Was still form fitting, even if I had gotten the L, I still would have been okay but it would have been tight and maybe a little shorter. Also didn't think this costume was super short either.

Having said that, the hat doesn‚Äôt fit well on my 2.5 year-old daughter and the plastic piece that helps you adjust the hat doesn‚Äôt work very well (doesn‚Äôt stay fastened shut). My daughter enjoys wearing the jacket and playing with the blow horn, though.

  I ordered on the smaller side after reading majority of reviews indicating the costume fit a little larger, (ordered a medium when I usually wear a large) and it fits perfectly. Everything is in good shape (the necklace is pretty cheap as reviews indicated, and I'll be buying something else) and I'm happy with the costume.  Worth the money paid.

  The jumpsuit is pretty cool and of good quality.  I am writing a review to reiterate what I read on other reviews for other sizes.  The crotch on the suit is waaaayyyyy to high.  I am 6 ft, 260 lbs. and while I feel the suit fit well everywhere else it was unbearable due to the fact that my butt had to eat the crotch of the pants to get it on.  It got me a good laugh from my wife but there was no possibility of wearing it.  I have returned it for the 3X.  I just hope the bigger size will correct the crotch issue, give a little more room, and I hope I won't be swimming in the suit.

  I returned this because the size chart measurements don‚Äôt match the costume. The size large runs like a small/medium. Also, for $40 it‚Äôs incredibly cheap. The white top is paper thin and itchy.

  I wore this costume to work, so I was relieved to find it comfortable and cute. I didn't find an issue with it riding up (and my butt is on the bigger side), but I wore fishnets with it, so they may have kept it in place. I am 5'3"" and 100lbs and it hot right below my butt. I would definitely recommend some black shorties if you are any taller. It is machine washable! I'm not sure if he I frictions recommend machine washing or not, but I risked it and the costume still looks great.My only complaint: the straps were a little big, but I used the arm band to secure the straps together in the back and it was no longer an issue.

  This is a great, well made, sturdy costume.  My son loves it - he loves playing policeman, especially the handcuffs. Only downside is the walkie-talkie which burned through a new battery overnight (we forgot to turn it off).  But even  with no battery it works when you just pretend.  He's even worn it out to dinner and people comment on what a great costume it is.  Melissa & Doug make really high quality stuff--this is no exception.

  Was really impressed with the quality of the costume and the accessories for the price.  My 2 year old wore it for Halloween, she was a ""princess ballerina"" and she was obsessed with this dress.  It was big enough that she wore it over a long sleeve shirt and pants.  One strange thing, though; I accidentally bought 2 and so when I opened the box I was surprised.  However.  The first package I opened had a TERRIBLE chemical/fishy smell that made me want to throw up.  Oddly enough, when we opened the second costume, there was NO SMELL and it was absolutely perfect.  So we returned the smelly costume and it worked out having had bought two accidentally.

  Way too much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Jurassic T-Rex Inflatable for Adults is frickin' funny!~The fabric and zipper are great quality and will last for an entire event or multiple uses though you do have to watch for sharp edges just like most all costumes. Ya might wanna stay away from a smoking area, just in case because it would deflate and you'd look like sad T-Rex and no one wants that.~It doesn't look cartoon-ish as in colors or design, it looks like the picture with the browns and blacks dark enough as well as the mouth. You still wouldn't be mistaken for a real T-Rex so no worries there.~The cuffs and ankles have strong elastic though some reviewers mentioned they used tape to keep the air in. I suppose if you wear it to work every day it could stretch out but otherwise, it isn't a problem.~The viewing area is clear plastic under the chin so it's fun to try to walk through doorways or down steps since the head will flop all over making T-Rex look more...irritated.~It takes a couple of minutes to inflate (well, on an adult sized adult is wouldn't be as long) so when friends call from 10 minutes away, you can be ready to greet them in fabulous style.~It didn't get too hot or fog the view area but it's still snowing on and off and kept me warm. Summers would be a great way to lose weight if you wore it...roller skating? which I'd do around a lake up here just in case I needed to cool off. Hopefully no one will call animal control about that.SIZING:It runs a little small I think, I'm 5'3"" 115lbs and it was just right for viewing because you could only see my eyes and not my face, no need for tape on wrists and ankles holding the air just fine. I'd say it would probably fit someone comfortably 5'10"" 170lbs-ish though some reviewers haven't had a fit issue that are much taller. It would fit a general range of adult & teens as there was a lot of room in the rest of the costume which is why I put ""fit as expected"".The only drawback is the fan is really noisy, enough to where it bothered my Granddaughter so I had to take it off and couldn't hear people clearly that were in the same room. From the reviews, it wasn't something I expected to be that loud which is why I'm giving it 4 stars.Maybe I need to use some WD40 on it and see if it quiets down, otherwise, these are fun and have so many places to wear them just so people know you are the good kind of crazy.

  This costume is really cute. It's made out of a nice form-fitting stretchy material. The length was not too short like some other sexy costumes. My only complaint is the sizing. I normally wear a size 8-10 and weigh 150 lbs. I'm 5 ft 10. Looking at the size charts for dream girl brand, I should fit into the large. Well I ordered extra large just to be on the safe size but it was still a bit too tight. I could've worn but not comfortably. I would say extra large would fit best for 5 ft 7-5 ft 10, up to 30 inch waist, 36-38 chest, up to 38 hip.

  This is a well-made set that will spark the imaginations of children ages 18 months on up.  My 21 month old is particularly taken with it -- it is a little big on him but not unwearable.  The tools that it comes with are sturdy, and the hat is adjustable.  The vest is pretty easy for toddlers and  preschoolers put on independently, and the velcro closure is easy to use as well.  My kids really like abundant pockets so they can properly pack up their tools.

  I got this for my 4 year old and he absolutely loves it! It's just like the power rangers on TV! I have already had to sew up a hole in the underarm though, but he plays pretty rough.

  I purchased the doctor costume for my daughter for Christmas. It comes in a little plastic bag, (similar to what you'd get for your clothes from a dry cleaner), which is nice to keep around so you don't lose any of the accessories.You do need batteries! The kind you use for a watch in the stethoscope.On that note, you may get very tired of hearing the smoker's cough sound effect that comes out of the stethoscope. It switches back and forth between that and a heart beat. There are little plastic discs on the part of the stethoscope that would traditionally go in your ears, those are a little on the rough side and could hurt if your child stuck them in their ears, I recommend only putting it around their neck. It still can potentially scratch them, it needs to be polished or have a better quality.The thermometer is just a play one, you click it and it turns to different temperatures.The plastic on the ear checking instrument is a little on the rough side too where it may go in someone's ear.The doctor's mask has some velcro on the parts that are elastic that go around your child's ears, I'm not sure if it's my daughter having a smaller head, but this doesn't seem like it would aid too much in adjusting the size, this thing always comes off.Overall I'd say most of the plastic where it may have been cut by a machine might have some roughness to their edges. But I would still recommend it for price, alternatively you could buy a separate play doctor's kit to go with the jacket, which to me is the main selling point.

  I would highly recommend the dress but not the accessories. The dress is beautiful for the price but the accessories are not worth any money at all. My wand came with the jewel pieces broken out in the bag. The earrings came broken as only one had the clip for clipping onto the ear. And lastly the crown it came beautifully placed in the bag it was packaged in but in taking it out of the bag and trying to fit the crown together I quickly realized the crown would not click on as it was supposed to because the circle on the tiara, that clicked onto the peg on the head piece, was cracked in half and would not stay connected to the peg.

  The item is listed and manufactured as adult sizes, but I couldn't disagree more. I am a thin 5'2 female and found the size Medium for men's to be short and tight. The ankles and mask are so tight they feel like I'm having my circulation cut off. The good news is that the material was better than expected and is flexible enough to be in at reasonable and considerable movement. I would absolutely not recommend this for adults unless ordering 2-3 sizes up. This is fitted for kids and preteens however. My personal belief as well is that this costume is a tad overpriced. Other than that, it works to use for a couple times at conventions like I have used it.

  My son wanted this for halloween.  He is 5'5 and 165 pounds at 12 years old.  When we got the costume we tried it on and found it was somewhat difficult to put on...awkward to say the least and def a 2 person job.  The costume came with all the correct parts and seemed to be made well however, on Halloween it didn't last more than 15 minutes.  We managed to go trick or treating at 6 houses and the costume began to fog up.  We had to stop to clean the view vent from the water accumulating and while doing so the costume ripped at the seam.  There was no pressure put on the seam it just ripped and wouldn't re-inflate as a result.  Needless to say my poor kid had no backup costume and ended up trick or treating in a t-shirt and shorts.  Worst of all, he had sweated so much inside the costume his clothes he wore underneath were soaking wet.  While this is a cute concept, it didn't work for us and was frustrating to have spent so much money only to have it rip and fog up. (sorry the photo is side ways, I can't get it flipped).

  Very good plus; I ordered this Dec 4th and got it by Dec 9th (with standard shipping.) Like the other reviews mentioned, the wig was not all that wearable. It's stringy, like Raggedy Ann hair. Ha. But wasn't a huge deal to me. The back is also solid pink. But I really like the length of the costume and the price is fair.

  I am 5'4'', 118 lbs and this fit just right. In my opinion, it would be too short and tight for anyone that is taller or larger. It was comfortable, as far as Halloween costumes go, and I got lots of compliments on it. The hat does not stay on, but you could probably use a string or something to keep it on.

  Great costume that does not require much else. A pair of black sweat pants and some black sneakers, or boots, completes it. It is nice and warm to wear without a jacket, in 50 degree weather, which is usually what we get in NJ around the end of October. Most other costumes need to be worn with a jacket, thus obscuring what the person is trying to be. Very comfortable and true to size.

  This costume is difficult to correctly state the size. Overall, it was a tight fit in the chest area. However, the sleeves were very long and the hood was huge. When worn, it covered my entire face and made it impossible to actually wear as intended. I would have returned it, however I missed the deadline. Looks like I have a donation to Goodwill.

  Thick material - perfect for a chilly Halloween! The tail is long and heavier than I expected - similar to the photo, I would walk around for the night with mine hooked onto my arm. Me and two roommates ordered these as costumes - some of the earlier reviews mention tearing and only one of us noticed a small tear along our tail at the end of the night. Otherwise, we were quite pleased! We paired these with red keds and knee-high socks and they were a hit!

  On her mother's suggestion we bought Melissa& Doug Doctor Role Play Costume Set for our three-year-old granddaughter's birthday.  Her older siblings had to at first explain and demonstrate the different ""instruments"" which came with it but once she caught on, she had a great time the rest of evening going from person to person doing exams and giving shots.  Of course, her older sister also had to see if she could fit into the doctor's coat as well. As a whole the costume and accompanying instruments were definitely a success and my older granddaughter has already pointed out to me which Melissa and Doug costume she wants for her next birthday!

  This fits as expected but only because I read the other reviews. Also, when I read other reviews that mentioned the back panel was all pink, I thought they meant just the back but actually the whole back side of the dress is pink and see through. The wig is more of a Raggedy Ann style and is totally bald - like a reverse mullet. I bought a different wig for the costume and was again grateful for all of the other reviews so I wasn't surprised. For a costume company this item was made very lazily. Also, it is printed so would it have been so difficult to just print on the back too? All in all, it is a great costume which is why I rated it four stars. It is very comfortable.

It is a leotard type of dress so going potty is slightly annoying but she's used it with rompers etc. Adorable dress with a great price. I've hand washed and she's gotten everything on it from toothpaste to chocolate on this dress and it's come off.

  I was very happy with this costume.  Some folks at work did not recognize me in this outfit with a black wig.  I got a free sample of darker foundation from Sephora and watched a tutorial on youtube on how to look like a female pirate.  I left the belt at home and traded the pants for a heavier pair since I live in the frozen north and Halloween tends to be a bit cold.  The vest is attached to the white shirt making for a comfortable fit.  If this tickles your fancy, buy it!!

  This dress is beautiful and the quality is great. I think the quality is much better than the expensive dresses from the Disney store. The size runs true; my daughter wears a size 6 and the size 6 dress fits perfectly. The skirt is full and poofy and covered in gold designs. The sleeves are sheer but re material is thicker and more durable than other Disney dresses.

  My favorite is that it is slightly puffy like a ball gown. This dress looks just like picture you definitely get what you see, which is so nice when ordering cloths online. Size runs slightly on the small size. Sleeve are mesh so after a little wear they tend to come up or roll up but still look beautiful just not good for cold weather. My daughter loves this dress!

  I will be returning this item but not because I don't like it. Simply because I took a chance and it was too big :(, I ordered the 3x/4x and it doesn't fit my size 18 frame. I believe the length doesn't work either because it's swimming on top. I would have been more comfortable with the 1x/2x however they were sold out. If you are looking to purchase this item and are on the fence, DO IT! It's a beautiful costume. My only gripe (and the reason it is 4 stars instead of 5) is the material and sheerness of the body suit that accompanies the costume. Beware as it is literally see through. While most of the body suit is covered by the costume, if a strong wind blows - your entire backside will be exposed. Honestly - beautiful costume for plus size females!!! I look forward to ordering something else from Leg Avenue in the future.

  Love this costume!!! I was hesitant to purchase the 12-18m thinking it may be on the smaller size.... it fits perfectly!!! I can say our little guy wears between 18-24m so these outfits run on the larger side. We also purchased the lion costume 18-24m for our little guy that wears 2T and that also fits well. A little shorter on the height (legs) but the arm length and torso area fits perfectly!!! These costumes are well made!! I love the snaps, zipper, and that the hoods are attached!!!! The inside of the costumes are also soft, no scratchy irritating fabric!!! Only con is they do not offer larger sizes! Would love to continue buying this company's costumes in the future years!!! Hopefully they will consider extending sizes to toddler sizes!!!

  This is a really cute costume made with decent fabric however I found the Small too short for someone of my height (5'0 ft). It does hugs nicely but is more revealing than you'd imagine. I'm a 32DD and found the top a little more revealing than I'm comfortable with (About as much coverage as a demi bra) but overall I'm pretty pleased with my purchase! If you don't mind the cheesy collar fabric, VERY short length, and slimming hug, I'd recommend this! Buy a size up!!

  This is a classic costume. It is pretty funny and a great idea. Though, the costume does feel a little cheap for the cost of it. The material feels cheap and thin. I was worried about popping the costume if it comes in contract with a sharp object. No accidents have occurred but it seems like it could easily happen to anyone walking around. They costume is also not breathable. If you live in a hot place like myself it may not be the best choice because you will most likely sweat and be uncomfortable. Other than that it is a good costume if you are careful.

  ¬†The photo is just a try on. I got the package after dinner and wanted to try it on right away so I have no makeup on and I just put the head piece on over my fro just to get a sense of the overall look.I love everything about this outfit. I saw a review where someone purchased this outfit on sale for $35 so it was a bit hard coughing up $59 for it when I am currently ‚Äúbroke‚Äù after reading all the reviews I ordered this in a XS which cost $3 MORE than the small. People putting their measurements and the size costume they ordered really helped me in deciding the size I should order so I will continue on with that helpful trend. In regular clothes I am NOT an extra small but the costume Gives a bit of wiggle room. I am 5/6 in height, 135 lbs, 34a in bra, 27 inches waist, 37hips. The black onesie  underneath was a bit loose, not terrible, but I wish it was skin tight. The outer part fits perfectly. In the photo I am wearing green thong underwear and it‚Äôs not visible, you CAN wear underwear with this costume it just have to be high on the hips. When I wear the costume I will obviously be wearing black undies. The costume is quality. I am not wear a bra but will consider wearing one when I officially wear the outfit. The panels/skirt is s but long but that‚Äôs something that can be altered to suit your size. By the way.. You can wear the black piece by itself to seduce your hubby into buying another expensive costume next yearüòâ I hope this review helps someoneüëçüèø

  Like other reviewers suggested, I sized up. I found it pretty long. The opening for the shoulders and neck is rather wide. The fin on the back is indeed pretty low. It'd be nicer if it was higher up, but it didn't bother me too much. The only actual downside to this (in my opinion) is that it gets really hot when you have it on. The felt it's made out of is extremely thick, and I unfortunately could not wear it out for Halloween (SoCal weather). If you live in a colder area, I highly suggest this, as it'll keep you extremely warm. The sleeves weren't as tight as it's shown in the photo for me. The costume itself is pretty comfortable.

  I‚Äôm a kindergarten teacher and we‚Äôve been learning about dinosaurs. I promised them a visit from a dinosaur and purchased this costume for the exciting event. The package arrived the night before I was suppose to wear it to school, since that was the last day of our dinosaur unit.The costume was missing the battery pack to operate the fan to inflate the costume. Leaving it completely useless. I spent 3 hours and went to 8 different stores to try to find a way to inflate this costume and no one could help because the costume uses a fan that was made back in the 1800s. To add the cherry on top, it was also missing the gloves... not that it mattered because the costume was completely useless anyways.I will NEVER buy from this supplier again. Useless and disappointing.

  I am so excited for Halloween this year.  I usually have no clue until literally days before and then I am ""stuck"" with whatever I can throw together.  I got a size up and yes I could have fit into my regular size.  I did this because I wanted to be able to wear leggings under the dress because sometimes it is a tad cold here on Halloween.  Yes, the back of the dress is a solid pink but it just a costume and one at a decent price.  Yes, the wig could use more yarn.  Personally, I think you could add more to it pretty easily if you are even the slightest bit crafty.  I am just going to wear it as is.  I am a school teacher and I think my students will love it and not really care about the wig.  This will not be winning any Cosplay awards but then that is not its purpose.  I am going to wear it and totally enjoy my day!

  I read a lot of reviews trying to figure out the right size to order, so hopefully this will help others. I'm 5'9"", 180 (+/-) lbs, athletic build, typically wear M slim-fit shirts, 33x30 pants. The S/M was the right size for me. Sleeves were just a little shorter than I would have liked (maybe another 1/2""-1"") and the legs were a bit long (2""), but with boots, it wasn't really that obvious. The overall fit was good. It was just a little tight when fully zipped and getting on/off - once you step in, getting the arms took a little twisting. The front has a double zipper so when zipped up with the top zipper, you can also zip up from the bottom when nature calls.The costume itself is great - good quality, many zipper pockets (2 chest pockets, 1 upper right thigh, 2 lower leg) and front/arm patches. As noted, there are both Maverick and Goose velcro patches. As others have noted, the bottom of the legs have zippers so I don't think there is a (easy) way to hem the legs if needed. There are also velcro bands on each wrist and both sides of the waist, to tighten as needed.Add a pair of sunglasses and dog tags (bought on Amazon) and you're all set!I also bought the M/L since I wasn't sure which size would fit. I didn't even bother trying it on, the legs would have been comically long.

  Very disappointed in the helmet. The internal piece that holds it on the head does not work at all. There are two points with multiple holes to adjust the size, but it won't hold. Constantly popping open. I solved that problem by sewing both sides shut with an upholstery needle. Unfortunately, when the head holder is sized smaller, it isn't big enough to fit into the four peg holes that secure it to the helmet. The helmet won't stay on by itself, way too big and shallow.  It's Halloween today and too late to find a better helmet. I'm really bummed. Tried supervising the holder in, but it's not going to hold.

  For the cost of this product (not cheap) I expected more than what I received. The stripes which are beautifully lined up on the model are not lined up on the actual dress that I received. This makes the dress look weird to anyone who has any eye for detail, style or good taste. The fit of the dress is ok. It is too long by many inches, even in heels. The body suit could be tighter and stretchier. It‚Äôs too late to return, so hopefully in dim lighting both my dress and I will look fabulous. Ha.

  I'm not big on halloween but I'm a nanny and trick-or-treating is in the job description. I wanted to dress up, but not as ""sexy nurse"" or any of the other scantily clad halloween tropes young women seem to get stuck with. Searched amazon for plus sized costumes hoping to find something a bit more conservative and got this! I was able to just wear black clothes under this costume/jacket/bat-hoodie and it was perfect! The hood stays put, the ears are filled so they stay up, the outfit was warm and comfortable and fit perfectly! This product is exactly as advertised and a perfect lazy costume. I'm psyched that I already know what I'll be wearing next halloween!!(It was a little warm this year and despite short sleeves under I did get a little hot under the fleece, but any other year I think warm would be a good thing.)

  For what it is, I thought it was really good - but based on other reviews here, I bought the XL (I'm 6'1"" and about 210 lbs).  It's HUGE - really long and baggy in the legs especially.  I think I'm just in between sizes, but if you're smaller than I am, go with the M/L (which my brother in law got).  He's 5'10"" and around 175 lbs and it fit perfectly.  Otherwise, it's a fun costume that comes with both the ""Maverick"" and ""Goose"" patches (which attach with velcro).

  This is a pretty decent product.  Our kiddo liked it very much. The jacket was much nicer than we thought it would be, and it has reflective strips sewn into it. The accessories are lower quality than the jacket. The toy fire extinguisher (just a plastic bottle) is not bad, but the megaphone is kinda cheap  It's not really a megaphone, just a siren (two AA required), and the button is up on the side instead of on the handle (which makes no sense). Still, our kiddo enjoyed it.

I actually could have gone a size smaller I am 5 foot 9 about 300 pounds and we're between a 20 and a 22 pants and a 2X top I opted for the 3/4 x which is actually slightly too big but comfortable and not noticeably too large. I will say that's address is super long so if you are short you're probably going to have to cut it. Again I am 5 foot 9 and it drags on the ground with me Barefoot at least 12in in the back

  My 2 year old son loves dressing up like a doctor/nurse! This will be part of his Halloween costume this year but also a fun toy he can dress up in and use year round. My son is between 2T and 3T clothing sizes. This jacket is a little big for him but he does not seem to mind. I like that he has room to grow and will get some longevity out of it. We simply roll up the sleeves and it's fine. The tools are great, easy to clean, fun to play with. He likes to use the stethoscope which makes a heart beat type sound when you press down on the diaphragm/bell. He also like the pumper (syringe), we are all now well vaccinated and then some.

  I bought this for my train loving son.  It does look cute on him but is baggier than I would like.  He just turned 4 and is big for his age.  I was worried about ordering this because I read some reviews that said the hat was too small.  The hat that came with mine has elastic in the back and will be plenty big for any childs head which makes me think they must of updated the costume.  I thought the walkie talkie did not work but it just did not come with batteries.  It is a nice addition to the play factor and makes train sounds at a very low volume (thank goodness!).

  I have to say that everyone loved this costume.  It was a huge hit for my sons Halloween  activities.  Saying that, it embodied the trick or treat mantra because while it was a treat for everyone watching my son, (especially when he ran, jiggling the dino-bootie and when he fell on his back and couldn't get up) he felt a little on the tricked side.  Keep in mind, he is 9 yo, but the window did fog up on him, and he had trouble seeing after dark.  We finally had him stick his head out the top of zipper and was fine.The costume stood up to a few hours of walking on sidewalks and road, as well as quite a few deflates and reflates.  I did have to do a minor repair at the top of the zipper, but to my surprise I was able to sew it, and it held up fine.Overall, it is a great costume, but remember to wear light clothes, because it is warm and it is probably better suited for a party than trick or treating,  and is built well.  If you are on the line, go for it and get it, you will not regret it.

  Matches the high quality one would expect from Melissa & Doug, it's well made, and better quality than most halloween or dress up type costumes.  Depending on the size of your child, I would say this probably would work on those between about 4 and 8, unless they are tall for their ages.

  I got so many complements on my costume. So many people wanted to take pictures with me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 155lbs and ordered a medium. The body suit was a little big but the zip up dress fit perfectly. I read the reviews so I expected the body suit to be a little big. The body suit is sheer but not completely see through. I would recommend wearing a high waisted thong underneath. Wearing shorts in my opinion takes away from the outfit.

  This costume is ultra sexy and very comfy. I wore a black thong with it as the back has just enough material to cover half of both cheeks. The front and back are the same except the backside has a little more coverage. I tend to be on the thicker side and the material was stretchy enough to be comfortable. I did have to cut the skirt in the front and back as these costumes are usually made for women who are taller. I am 5‚Äô3 and 165 lbs. It looked amazing!

  The quality was as expected from the brand. For the price, very probably the best Dr. dress up set. My daughter loves the Doc McStuffins show, so we thought it would be fun if she had her own outfit. It's been almost a year and she still plays with the toys and outfit, which by the way have not gotten damaged after normal wear and tear over that time frame. The batteries last a very long time in these toys, which is always a big plus when toy shopping.The coat fit a 4T pretty well, and probably a bit larger than that even. But even after that gets outgrown, the toys that come with the set will keep on ticking.For the price range of this toy/outfit, you just won't find anything better.

  This is my preschooler's second Melissa and Doug costume (he also has the fire fighter set). This is very high quality. He loves the walkie talkie that comes with it. My only complaint is the whistle they include. Not many parents want their kids blowing a whistle around the house. It also seemed a little small, making me worried about choking hazard (we ended up hiding it, because we also have a 17 month old and I really don't want her to have it for safety reasons, but also I don't want them both mouthing it and sharing germs). Perhaps a better accessory would have been a holder or pad to go along with the ticket (which my son loves to give out, by the way). Overall a great item that encourages role play with kids.

  My 29 month old daughter LOVES this more than I could have imagined.  We customized the name badge provided in the pocket before wrapping it up for Christmas.  She plays with it daily.  I think the coat and mask are critical pieces that many other doctor play sets don't include. The stethoscope could be more real-life, but I think we'll just buy a real one when she's a bit older so she can really listen to our heartbeats.  For now the toy one included in this pack is fun - it requires 2 AAA or AA batteries and makes a heartbeat sound and coughing sound.  For older children - buy a real stethoscope to add on.  I highly recommend this set.  Melissa & Doug products are constantly impressing me.

  I usually wear a size 10 so I ordered a large and it fit pretty well. The fur around the hood wasn‚Äôt the best quality but the costume itself was super cute. I though it was pretty flattering on- the wings help hide if you‚Äôve got a little bit of a belly. It‚Äôs a very thick fleecy material. I ended up returning because it was too heavy for me and I didn‚Äôt want to sweat all night. I live in Florida so even a cool Halloween is likely to not be cool enough for this heavier material. That‚Äôs the only reason I returned it.

  Good product if you are 4'09 or smaller. Im 5'04"". Screw on battery pack took a minute. Screwed on tightly. In order to see anything I had to stand bent over with neck in odd position. Which after 2 minutes became irritating. The costume filled up after a few minutes. The feet of the costume was in a weird position also. Finally I was hot and wanted to take it off. With the zipper behind me, I had to scream my daughters name to unzip immediately. You can feel trapped in this thing. Funny costume if you are a child or short.

  My son LOVES this costume. He is average height and weight for a 3 year old. The jacket could fit a 5 year old, but I like that he has room to grow into it while still fitting him enough to play in it now. The accessories are durable and realistic and the jacket is excellent, heavy-duty quality. The reflector stripes actually do reflect, too, which is a fun component. The hat, which can take a real beating and still come out without a crack, sometimes falls off, but there is an adjustable part inside that helps once you get the right fit. My only issues is the velcro holders for the megaphone and fire extinguisher. The holder is two straps that velcro together, but it is very challenging for my son to maneuver the velcro and position the toys simultaneously to hang them there on his own. Overall, though, my son is VERY happy with his firefighter costume. It is absolutely worth spending a little more on this specific firefighter costume for the quality.

  This is my favorite thing in the whole wide world. I‚Äôve already recouped 60% of the cost by winning $30 in a costume contest at work. I also wore it to see my friends‚Äô new baby and terrify their 18-month-old, as well as to a wedding rehearsal and dinner that were costume parties on Halloween weeekend. The perfect gift for any attention monger like myself. My two complaints that do not warrant a star being taken off are: 1) the wrist and ankle cuffs tend to ride up. It would be nice if they had a stirrup seen in to help keep them in place. I might find s way to do this myself. The mitts help keep the wrists in place a little better but there‚Äôs not much hope for the ankles. 2) I dropped the battery pack (my bad) and it split in half and one of the battery springs broke off and rolled away into the abyss off multicolored office carpet, never to be seen again. But I McGyvered it with the spring from a click pen and carried on to win my costume contest. Now off to panhandle on the streets by charging passersby to pose for pictures with me. I do in all seriousness want to run my next 5k wearing this. Again‚Äîattention monger.

  This is the best costume ever, a one piece lycra jumpsuit. It is so realistic and well made. I am a woman 5'8"", 32 inch waist, men's size 7 shoe, very athletic build. I went with s medium not a large like the package recommended and it fit great, very stretchy and could fit someone a bit larger. The only thing big on me was the feet which could probably fit up to a 9 shoe and the crotch since it is made for men. The hooded mask was just right with not much room left. It is skin tight so if you don't people to see your imperfections you might not like it. The only thing you might need to do is reinforce the feet. You could stand around indoors ok but if you are walking outside or jumping around they will rip. I bought a small tube of shoe goo and spread a good layer on them which was perfect. Also threw some insoles from my sneakers in them which was so comfortable and you couldn't  see them at all. Won best costume. I have been a collector of spiderman costumes and this is hands down the best one by a mile! I spent more on lunch than this costume!

  I bought this costume for a Halloween party and was unable to wear it because it was too small. Based on product reviews I ordered a larger size than I would normally wear. However, it was still too small to wear. I am 5'6 and weigh 175 lbs. I ordered a large but it was too small. Unfortunately, I couldn't exchange for a large size due to availability. And I couldn't return the costume due to the seasonal return party.

  Very nice play outfit with several included items, made well EXCEPT for the siren although annoying as its loud once its dropped Yes by a 4yr old boy the batteries 2 AA not included make for the connections to break loose, although being handy I was able to just bend the springs back into a more secure place this should be incorporated into the product knowing kids will drop these while playing. Also the siren is heavy with the batteries so having it on the belt/outfit does not work well and comes loose when running around. I still give this a solid 3 stars though as its not just a cheap costume that is bought at a box store at halloween time its color and features are great for real time play

  Forewarning-this costume is very warm! That being said I really enjoy my bat dress, and the ears are sort of reminiscent of a cat!This is very form fitting, which is part of the reason it's so warm! Definitely double-check on the size, as I ordered a small (I'm technically an XS) and it fit my body great, but felt a touch tighter than I generally prefer on the arms, which probably honestly helped the wings stay in place without sliding.Consider purchasing Vampire Teeth, as it felt extra batty to me! Fluffy black boots look nice too!

  Totally disappointed in this costume. I'm, first of all a guy who uses his wife's Amazon account, thus the name. I'm 5'7"", 180. I wear a 34"" in pants. I bought a large, which is supposed to fit 37""-39"" waist. This is an awful costume. I was encouraged by the one photo that was posted of somebody in action in this costume. Made it look like a steal.The top was a bit oversized and the leather part -- which is most of the front of the top -- is cheap, cheap plastic. Stiff, doesn't move great. It looked and felt awful to wear. The pants, which were supposed to fit a guy who is 39"" are too small for a guy who's a 34"". The belt did not even fit all the way around me and, because it's Velcro, would not stay on even when forced.The 2-star rating is only elevated by the fact that it comes with a lot of chintzy accessories. The hood was pretty cool. I didn't even bother with the gloves but they looked huge, so that was a NOPE. There's a lot to this costume for the price they're asking. It would be a better costume if they cut half of the crap out and actually concentrated on making it a worthwhile purchase. Instead, it's an unusable costume because I'd say the top is an XL and the bottoms and belt are a S/M. This is going back. I spent $10 *more* but got a better costume at Spirit Halloween, which I was able to try on in-store.

My four year old will be wearing it as a Halloween costume and then keeping it to use for dress up.  Far better than items sold strictly for Halloween use and at about the same price point.  Fits true to size I would say 3-6 years ideally.My only issue is the plastic adjustable insert in the helmet falls out very easily, added some hot glue and it works perfectly.

  On one hand, this costume was a success in that my son enjoys it  and frequently as to put it on when he is playing with friends. On the other hand though, I find that it's super, super cheap. The tools are so light that they fall out of the pockets really easily. I had to add some weight to the hammer by filling it with washers so it would stay in his pocket for all of Halloween. The hat is also  super annoying and that it has a detachable adjuster that falls out all the time leaving my son just wearing kind of like a plastic halo around his head with the hat on the floor.  I ultimately wound up buying him another hardhat altogether because it was pretty frustrating to him. I don't think I would buy this costume again. I would just assemble a construction costume by buying each piece individually from another company.  We also have the Melissa and Doug police costume, which I would say is much better than this one l.

  It's a hilarious costume so I won't rate it lower.Hilarious costume fun to play in. This costume could fit different sized people from 4.5 to 6.5 feet tall. It packs up small.Things to be aware of:Included fan is just garbage - mine broke right away and I had to take apart to resolder the wires. It rattles and barely inflates the suit, plus is loud. I ended up finding a high flow 75+ CFM 120mm computer case fan and making a replacement fan housing out of a plastic tube. This was powered with 9V batteries and inflated the suit better and more quietly than the included fan.The suit is hot. Even my more powerful fan only helped a little. After several minutes you will want cool air.Rips can be repaired easily with duct tape on the inside, or Leukotape is almost the same orange and is extremely flexible and sticky.The sound unit is ridiculously overpriced. It plays one sound as far as I can tell and is not loud enough.

  ¬†This inflatable dinosaur costume is awesome!  I  absolutely love it!  Our whole family has had fun, chasing each other around in it, dancing, surprising delivery people, and lots of other silly stuff. The fed ex delivery guy had a good laugh and said it made his day when a T-Rex opened the door. He said he‚Äôs seen a lot of strange stuff while making deliveries, but it was the first time he‚Äôs ever delivered a package to a dinosaur. It‚Äôs hard not to have fun wearing this costume. It fit everyone from my daughter who is 5‚Äô2‚Äù tall to my husband who is 6‚Äô tall. There were only a few features that I wasn‚Äôt crazy about, but they were definitely out numbered by the positive features and sheer fun of the costume. The arms are short and they are at an awkward height, but that‚Äôs just T-Rex anatomy.  The ‚Äúmittens‚Äù fit well and when tucked into the elastic on the end of the sleeves, they stayed on well. I found the costume surprisingly comfortable and easy to move around in once I got used to the arms. The fan is kind of loud but it inflates the costume quickly and keeps it inflated well.  Having someone hold the head up while it is inflating until there is enough air for it to stand on its own helps . There is good airflow inside the costume once it is inflated. It can however get a little warm inside  after a while if you are really active, especially running around outside in the summer. I really like the fact that there is a clip on the fan so you can clip it to the waist of your pants. It‚Äôs a little awkward if you aren‚Äôt wearing actually wearing pants (due to the heat in the summer) or if pants have an elastic waist. On those occasions, wearing a standard belt  (regardless of the pants situation) worked. The costume has held up well . The material is lightweight, but feels durable like parachute material. The clear window is easy to see out of although the range of peripheral vision is very limited.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and would buy another  if for some reason we ever have a need for more than one T-Rex.

  This was your typical Halloween costume. Not the best quality material, but good enough. This dress had a zipper which was nice! Since it's an a-line dress the bottom is forgiving on both sizes. I could've done the medium, but the chest area was way to snug (I'm a 34C) so to be comfortable all night I went with the large and that worked much better. Not as form fitting, but still looked good! I'm 5'5"" and 146lbs if that helps anyone! I did wear a fringe vest which helped a bit with the shortness. (I also wore shorts under it as well)

  Loved it ! I‚Äôm a 34DD and I weigh about 125 pounds and am 5‚Äô1‚Äù. Wore no bra; perfect fit everywhere! The gold one piece to wear under the costume is a bit loose, then again it seems kinda like a one size fits all kinda thing, or at least is loose enough for range of sizes and body types. It‚Äôs a great option to wear with the costume and really compliments the gold color! It would have been really hot for me and the outside Halloween event I attended. This costume is versatile in the sense where you can maybe wear shorts under or, like in my case, wear fishnet stockings. Maybe all black pantyhose. I feel as though you can really make the look with this costume how you want it and feel comfortable! My only advice is to properly measure the black fabric that hangs in the front and back with the shoes you will wear with the costume. I wore heels and it was still dragging on the floor. I should have cut it beforehand. But oh my god I love this costume and you will too! And by the way I ordered this the day before Halloween and paid shipping to receive on Halloween and received it between 12-1 pm mid day of Halloween! Super quick shipping and just awesome !

  I would normally wear a small, but I bought this in a large for a slightly loose, relaxed, oversized hoodie fit. I'm glad I ordered two sizes up, the sleeves are just the right length and there's just barely a little extra room underneath. It is also incredibly warm, so if that's something you're looking for in a costume, you won't be disappointed. I bought it as something to wear to the Disneyland halloween party. I wanted something to keep me warm outdoors late at night, something that wouldn't get in the way on rides or in crowds, or be at risk for getting messed up or losing pieces. Just something comfy, casual, cute, and also fits all the costume rules for the park. It is the perfect costume for what I was looking for and I'm very happy with it. There were just a couple things that kept me from giving it a 5-star review. First, that when I took it out of the package it had a very strong chemical odor that has taken a few days to air out, even after being washed. Second, the fur around the hood has a very rough edge, which I'm just picky about because I've worked with faux fur on craft projects before, and the craftsmanship seemed poorer than I expected for the price. However, it's still a cute costume that's perfect for what I need, and I expect I'll get a lot of enjoyment out of it!

  My son loves this outfit! The jacket is good quality, which is great because it will clearly get a lot of wear. The hat and bullhorn are also a hit, the horn makes a fire truck sound. I'm giving it 4-stars instead of 5 because of the fire extinguisher -- you can put water in it, but you can't really squirt it out. The water DRIPS out, which is kind of a buzz kill, when you're rushing to put out the fire, and then the water drips out of the fire extinguisher. Other than that, this purchase is a hit.

  I knew this costume would be too small when I ordered it. But with some modifications, and a pair of sweatpants, I got it working. It looks funny in back, but the front blends well. TIP: Stuff the legs with reusable heavy-duty plastic bags from the grocery store. I used a bunch from Food-4-Less (about $4 worth @ $0.10 ea.) They are light, firm, and bulky.

  I bought this in a size 4 for my granddaughter's recent fourth birthday and it fits nicely. She's kind of tall and thin so take that into consideration when ordering. The dress has no buttons or zippers to aid in getting it on and off, although there is a little stretch in the waist. It just gets pulled over the child's head or up over her hips. This is what's most important to consider in the dress fitting, unless you are a seamstress and want to modify it.The material is very pretty and soft against the skin thanks to lining. There's lots of fullness in the skirt and netting to support it. It was long enough to touch the floor and a bit too long for much activity. She stepped on it a time or two running around and nearly falling, so full of her birthday excitement.The sleeves are a lightweight, sheer/opaque fabric that also encircles the neck behind the collar and modestly covering the chest area.ReliBeauty shipped quickly, packaged their product well, and delivered within my expectations.

  This bat costume is great for cold weather because it is thick fleece material.. The hood is super cute and stays up without assistance. I ordered 2 sizes up so that it would be roomy and cover my bum. The only thing I DIDN'T LOVE about this costume is that unless you hold your arms out ALL THE TIME.. no one can tell what the costume is... You just look like a black fuzzy blob with ears on a hoodie.... So, I lined the wings with bright fabric piping... That helped, however you still need to hold your arms out for photos and such to truly see that it is a bat costume.

  My Kid loves the hoodie, but for the amount I paid, I didn't realize from the picture the only thing you got was the hoodie, no tights, or boot covers to actually complete the look my daughter fell in love with. You can get those tights but that's $10 and you can get furry boot covers but that's another $12. If you want a complete look this isn't a budget-friendly costume. If your kid is obsessed with hoodies like mine you will get enough wear out of it to be worth the cost because it is ""really comfy and warm""

  I bought this twice. The first time the top was too big. The bottom too small. The trim was half ripped off one sleave. There were no straps at all. The zipper on the bottoms unzipped itself constantly. I exchanged for a larger size. It fits perfectly! The sewing job is still cheap and disappointing. The trim was falling off in the the exact same spot. For how much this costs I shouldn't have to repair trim. But I am still keeping it and this is still my favorite Jasmine costume currently on the market.

  My three year old couldn‚Äôt wear the hat because it was poorly designed. It was way too short and the piece inside too flimsy to stay on his head.

  This costume was better than I expected considering the price.  The main piece is well constructed and nice quality.  I'm 5' 6"" 155 lb. with a slim build so I purchased a size Medium and it was a little large for me.  I'm just going to pin it in the back to make it work since I'm worried the Small may be too small for me.  This would have been a 5-star costume if the accessories weren't so cheap.  My first attempt to try on the right glove resulted in rip between the thumb and index finger, and I have small slender hands.  I put on the left glove on more gingerly but the glove didn't fit right at all.  As gloves, they were pretty useless so I cut the hand part of the gloves off and I'm just using the cuff parts on my forearms.  The belt for around my 32"" waist was surprisingly too small considering how large the costume fit so I'm not using the waist belt at all.  There's a second belt that goes over the upper chest that I really couldn't figure out how to put on but it seemed that it would cover the best features of the main piece.  I was able to modify this belt by cutting the shoulder strap and using the longer part of the belt around my waist, which I felt looked better than that cheap belt that was supplied for the waist in the first place.  The leg pieces were well constructed but very tight on my slender legs.  I just had to make a slight modification on the bottom to make them work with the only pair of brown shoes that I owned.  Overall I'm happy with the costume and can't wait to wear it for this year's costume party.

  This is a Juniors size, not a woman or kids. It does have a tie in the back, with the back being a solid color. The picture looks like the neck piece and gloves are white but they are the perfect Sally color. The wig is nice and full in the front but if you don't arrange it properly in the back you will see the attached cap that holds it on your head. For the amount of stuff you get I would say the price is not too bad but for the quality I would say it is a little high. But if you are looking for a Sally costume that is not overly sexulized the higher price is worth it.

  This costume is high quality!  It's a nice material, it looks sharp, and the accessories are NOT flimsy.  It's sturdy and has held up to many play sessions between my two children in which they pretend to be rescue workers.  The megaphone is their favorite and sometimes gets lost, but, if I can remember, it's easy to velcro right to the costume.The color is just as shown in the picture, a bright red, with great details.

  Product operated as it should. Because it is so thin, I assume for the inflation purpose, I felt we had to be extra careful when entering it or walking around. It can definitely puncture if you aren't careful enough. Also had to be careful with the zippers because it felt like it could easily tear if someone was too forceful. Inflation wasn't instantaneous but didn't take long. If wearing for Halloween trick or treating, here is what we experienced. 1. If getting in and out of a vehicle when trick or treating it will likely have to deflate and inflate each time going in and out of the vehicle because the head is tall and tail long. 2. Getting inside of the costume be sure to have your child duck under the zipper to pull it over. If they try to stretch it over their head it may bust the zipper out. 3. It was a little of a challenge for my child to see where their feet were going. Had to be the guide for some moments. 4. The battery pack for the fan clips on the child's waist of their clothing. Be sure they can handle that being clipped on there. 5. Because walking in a balloon is awkward, my child was getting tired of the walking  way before the other children. Once it got dark, the whole visual issue got worse as well. Overall, we still enjoyed the humor of the costume and people enjoyed seeing it. Just keep the points above in mind and consider the tendencies and tolerances of your child before buying.

  I'm 5 ft tall and 120 lbs, the small fit me perfectly. Good length. The only thing that annoyed me were the straps, as they are not adjustable. they would fall off occasionally. But then I found out I could criss-cross them on the back and that helped adjust them more. The gloves fit well. I bought the boots online as well and they looked amazing with the dress.

  I'm 5'8"" and 135 pounds and this costume fits me pretty well!  Doesn't look cheap and is very durable.  If you get this costume, plan on sewing/pinning the leg and arm ties in place where you want them, as they WILL slide down if you don't.  Also plan on wearing skin-colored, seamless undergarments with this catsuit, as it is very form fitting and panty lines/brightly colored undies will show through if you do not!

  This product is quite modest, but beautiful and  sexy. The quality is very good.  It's designed for a standard figure, which is not quite what I have. Initially, I had bought MEDIUM - my regular size - but it ran too large, so I had to reorder a small size. But I am a full figure, so it was not quite a fit,as I am bigger in chest that the small size and a little thinner is waist than the medium I had before.  But hopefully,  it stretches and I managed to slip in it, and it looks good to me. I recommend this costume for special occasions , such as Halloween or any costumed party.

  I'm 5'8'' and about 130 lbs - usually a size 4.I purchased this in a Large due to other comments, and size chart.It fits well, snug but not too tight, the fabric is fleece-like, has some stretch, and is very comfy and warm. Too warm for an indoor party.The length is strange on me - it's too long as a sweatshirt and too short as a dress. Length would be better on someone 5'4'' or less. I will wear with black leggings because it's so short. However, the length of the sleeves is perfect.The good thing about being tall is the rear fin is coming out of my back not out of my bum. Win!If it had pockets I would give it 5 stars.

  Loved my ninja costume. It was perfect for the party I attended. It fit great. Only reason it did not get 5 stars was the red tie for the leg kept on sliding down.

  I needed a Halloween costume for my son who just turned 6.  I chose Melissa and Doug because I know they are usually high quality and Amazon could get it to me fast.  I wasn't wrong!  High quality material, ours came on a little plastic hanger with a plastic covering so it can be stored again.  Front close is velcro so it was easy to get on and off.  The tools were made well and had fitted loops to hold them in (the saw kept falling out while trick or treating, though, so I carried that one after a while).  Another cute addition is the name tag- you can take it out and write your child's name on it, along with adding a photo if you want, so it looks like a real ID card!  Contrary to what others say in their reviews, our hat did come with an adjustable plastic ring inside of it, so you can change the fit of the hardhat.  We took it out all together since the hat fit my son well without it.  At the age of 6, this vest fit him just perfectly.  My son is tall and slender for his age.  He might be able to wear it again next year but my guess is it might be too short.  This was a comfortable costume for Halloween and my son wore it most of the day with no issues. Paired with kids work boots, it looked adorable!

The length is a little long, but with boots, there will not be a problem.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that there are no SUNGLASSES with the outfit, even though it is listed as included.

  This is a great suit and I‚Äôm very happy I bought it. It is real cotton fabric, albeit somewhat thin material. The patches are very good quality and you get both Maverick and Goose name patches to pick from. My one complaint is the legs are too long by a lot (8-10 inches). I had to roll them up because they went well past my shoes. Of note, I am a 5‚Äô 7‚Äù woman 225 lbs and carry most of my weight in my hips and thighs and the suit fit me comfortably, even loose. I can see how if someone has a long torso it might be a constricting fit as the torso was just about right on me. Overall, I recommend it and with good care you‚Äôll be able to reuse this suit many times.
